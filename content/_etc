For knowing Life's origin and nature we will have to observe and contemplate about the nature of energy and the journey in which all the infinite energy of existence is participating. 
### The journey of Life 

> Existence is not aimless. Every atom is self inspired and imbued with purpose. Every ounce of energy is undergoing through a unidirectional progression of development & evolution. 

#### 1. Development process

##### Energy that is not stably in equilibrium seeks stability of equilibrium.

> There are three kinds of activities of energy - making, breaking and balance (or stability).

_Please pay attention to this and contemplate for a while - The Space is energy in all-round equilibrium. Manifest energy is the energy which is not in equilibrium and is seeking the same. Manifest energy exists inseparably within the Space. Manifest energy is but the Nature itself and it is forever transient, **seeking stable equilibrium to be just like the silent Space within which it is contained**. Observe how energy flows from one form to another - from the rays of the sun to the food that you eat to the energy you expend in walking and that expended energy in walking converts to some other form of energy in an infinite flow. Once a unit of energy finds the stable equilibrium within - for example an atom, it stays compacted forever unless destroyed by external energy. **The atom likes to exist stably just like how it is**, even though it may move from here to there as part of a larger macro current (For example, atoms in the air or water). The pursuit to exist stably can be observed even in biological world as the innate drive of any species to adopt and strive for greater chances of survival._ 

This process of energy's pursual for stable forms and thereby engaging in compositions, temporary equilibriums and decompositions, can be called **development progress** wherein energy is seeking to develop into forms that stay stable (i.e. permanent). The tendency of energy (existence) to move towards and stay in stabile equilibrium is even recognised in science as second law of thermodynamics. We can also attest from our human experience that it is good to be in "balance". As humans we also prefer permanent solution to our needs over temporary ones. **Need for permanent balance (stability) is an innate drive of nature both material and conscious.** 

> Manifest energy, self organising as units with varied forms, seeks stability in constitution as a unit, where no part of that unit can be taken out and no part from outside can come within. 

#### 2. Development 
##### Birth of Life itself is development of energy. 

A unit of Life (like you and me) is indivisible and inseparable. A unit of energy finally developing into a stable (eternally existing) form is being called development. 

> Energy keeps on constituting and spilliting from various forms seeking stability of equilibrium, to ultimately reach a form which is stable and where the form's destruction is not possible no matter how strong the external forces. That type of unit of energy is Life, is akin to a conscious atom. It is what you and I are. We are permanent, indestructible and indivisible unit of energy.

Energy indeed achieves permanence as-a-constitutional-form when a unit of Life is born. Becoming a conscious bundle (atom or whatever you would like to name it) is the end of aeons of development process where energy comes together as an indestructible unit (Life). All ancient spiritual wisdom and for any human, a personal spiritual insight comes with the same realisational knowledge. 

_**I am. I am eternal. I am not this body. I am with this body.**_

Here are some points to think about Life, about yourself, your origin.

- Birth of Life is the final act of composition by a certain bundle of energy towards eternal permanence of its existence as that unit. After this composition, there is no decomposition of that composition of energy. This is the culmination of development process which that bundle of energy went through as free energy or as part of different atoms and molecules.

- The conscious atom (Life) has a certain _form and internal arrangement_ which allows it to be conscious of its existence in the [co-existence](/existence-itself-is-coexistence). At the moment of birth of Life, energy undergoes a change in its manifestation from inert physical energy which operates in the physical fields known to science like electromagnetic, gravitational, quantum fields etc., to conscious energy which operates on some transcendental fields of consciousness yet to be discovered by science (or most probably never will). From being physical atoms or free flowing energy, energy shifts to being another kind of _atom or unit of energy_ with a unique constitution that exhibits self consciousness and the ability to think, desire, hope, analyse, contemplate etc. _as an "I"_.

- Life is weightless as can be seen by weightlessness of thoughts, desires and hopes.

- Life enjoys freedom from physical forces like electromagnetism, gravity etc. It is pretty evident as desires and thoughts are not _governed_ by physical fields like gravity. We have power of control over our thoughts irrespective of the physical forces surrounding us. Even if my body has had lot of alcohol I percieve its effect but I always have _the potential_ to control how I think.
  
- Life is govered by the force of desire. Every desire is somewhere rooted in the pursuit of the deepest desire of _happiness, peace, contentment and bliss_ which is the same across every life. Even in animals but fully so in humans. 

- Life can consciously affect any part of the infinite existence. The extent of the effect is not limited or affected by distance. For example, affecting the thoughts of each other or listening to each other from thousands of kilometers apart. Inert atoms or big objects like Earth also affect entire existence through different fields like electromagnetic or gravitational fields, but the effect diminishes based on distance.

- Conscious energy can exert control over material energy. We are connected with a body (gross physical, subtle energetic, more subtle mental & most subtle causal) with which we do things and we percieve the world. Hence whatever Life is, it can connect with and affect matter and energy in physical fields through its body. Life is found to co-exist with the body. Upon contemplation it is revealed that Life can do nothing without a body. It always needs a body and always has one, whether physical, subtle or causal.  


#### 3. Evolution progress
##### Learning is evolution. The gradual realisation of true nature of Self and Existence, finding wisdom and increasing freedom from desires and aversions is evolution progress.

- With formation of a unit of Life that part of infinite manifest energy ends its journey of aeons of material development. It becomes _developed_. It finds its constitutional completeness as a unit of matter. From there it starts on another journey, possibly spanning aeons again. That journey is of _evolution progress or growth_. That journey is about discovery of own Self and finding the equilibrium within.
- This stage is what all of animal kingdom and most of humanity on Earth is going through. We are all on journey of evolution progress. We are all here to experience certain experiences very important and desirable to our causal Self and we are doing the same. As we gain more experience, we learn. As we learn, we evolve. 
- In this stage the perspective of Life evolves from personal like-benefit-profit to justice-dharma-truth. One evolves from being 'selfish' to 'selfless'. One is on journey from being a limited individual being feeling separate from rest of co-existence, to a universal co-existential being realising more and more the infinite and eternal nature of consciousness and the oneness and onlyness of all-that-is.
- As one learns more and more about the nature of Self and Existence, one finds greater harmony within and with the world. There is greater repitition of joy, heightened awareness and rightful conduct, action, work and behavior.

#### 4. Evolution
##### Full and final awakening, in continuity & for eternity is evolution. A part of the infinite existence achieves the final stage of development and evolution.

 - Evolution is becoming free from the force of desire or aversion. Once evolution fully happens, existence in form of that unit of Life reaches the pinnacle of its state of being. Evolution is also called awakening, enlightenment or liberation. It is the highest, eternally balanced and blissful state of consciousness to be in. Full evolution is Budhahood.

- When a Life is fully evolved it finds permanence of balance and harmony both within and with the world. It exhibits joy, heightened awareness
 and rightful conduct, action, work and behavior in eternal continuity.

- After evolution, there is happiness, peace, satisfaction and bliss in continuity. A fully evolved Life exhibits patience, courage, generosity, kindness, grace and compassion in continuity. Its perspective is permanently established in truthfulness-justice-dharma. 

## Why is it important to know who am I?
Unless you know for sure _who you are_, how do you know what _you_ really want, how can _you_ be really satisfied, happy, in peace and bliss? Humanity suffers today despite all the material and scientific development because it tried to fulfill human desire and solve human problems without knowing what a human is. How can you solve a problem for someone without knowing your subject itself?

So, without knowing yourself, you can not arrive at peace and resolution within and with the world around.
