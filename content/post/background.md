**We can all agree that happiness is the ultimate desire behind all desires and actions.** We live lifetimes, doing things in order to be happy and to know our selves, hence feeling happiness in pieces and being in some kind of unease for rest of the time. Not knowing what we need exactly, we keep trying this and that. In process, we have hurt the Earth and each other to a great extent. This is only making things worse. We need to awaken! Our lack of Understanding and Knowing existence and co-existence in a holistic and objective way, keeps us away from the Source of happiness and ease, which is eternal and omnipresent - available to everyone directly. Each one of us have the power and the choice to break from this repetitive patten. 

*This is what we wish to achieve as Lifemakers. We wish all human families to be happy, justful and mutually fulfilled. Humanity to be peaceful and benevolent. And all life on Earth to be thriving.*

As a growing family integrated by a holistic and same understanding of Life, we are together to protect and nurture Humanity and Earth. We are envisioning how can Humanity thrive together in abundance, along with Nature; as an unfading tradition independent of time.
