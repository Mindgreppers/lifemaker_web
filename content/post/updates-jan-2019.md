Hello my dear ones

Here are the updates from last two months of action at Lifemaker. 

* We successfully crowdfunded a movable film studio and started our outreach and awareness campaign with families in village Saalig actively.

* We kickstarted the cottage industry experiment by making home made Gajak with Desi Ghee and selling it without additional generation of plastic, in village shop, local market and as well sending to some friends across India. We learned a lot, especially the fact that the customer in market wants well packaged products. The time for open products is gone. The problem we then faced is: How to replace plastic packaging in a cost effective and process effective way?
