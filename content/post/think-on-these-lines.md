#### The essence of Human Life is wisdom and happiness.

Yet, do you find yourself or most of humanity, as resolved and happy? Do you find our current society, system and environment simple, fair and conducive for life? Have you ever felt the need that you need to arrive at the total/objective understanding of reality yourself, and living that way, instead of blindly following someone else or the general social prescription? Do you ever wonder that who else, if not us human beings, are responsible for all existing problems on Earth? *Have you ever wondered what is the solution?* 

Have you ever felt sad when you see the damage has been done to Earth - its air, water and the life on it? Have you ever wondered why do we lack mutual trust, understanding and fulfillment in our relationships - evidenced as broken society and weakening families? Have you ever realised how power and money has become our relegion, and selfishness our instinct, instead of shared happiness and mutual fulfillment? Have you felt sad seeing a war orphaned child or another one starving from hunger, while many of us waste food? Have you ever observed that even rich ones amongst us are not really happy in continuity? 

> Have you ever thought how much effort we do for survival and comfort of the body, but in comparison we do almost nothing for the mind, for relationships between life to life? Have you ever wondered which is of bigger value - the mind or the body? 

Do you foresee that given the current trend, our grandchildren are going to face even more complications, pain and suffering than us? Do you sometimes wish to pass on a better world to our children than the one we got? 

Have you ever felt the need for [a positive and sustainable change](/post/background) within you, within your family and the society? Have you ever wondered where does the power of right thinking and change lie - in the existing system, businessmen, relegions, governments or some other external agent or agency with superpowers? Or does it lie within each one of us? Do you wish to be in continuity of resolution, abundance, fearlessness and co-existential fulfilment? Do you wish to experience continuity of happiness, contentment, peace and bliss in your life and relationships? Are you waiting for someone to make the change happen in you, your family and neighborhood? Or are you feeling inspired to be the change you want to see?
