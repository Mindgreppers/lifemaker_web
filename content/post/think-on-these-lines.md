#### Have you ever wondered?

**Who am I in this human form and what is my innate purpose for existing? What is reality and how does it work? What is highest possible universally good applicable to every human - how does it look like, how does it feel and how can it be achieved? Can it be achieved alone or co-existentially? Am I ever alone in reality? Is everything whether material or conscious connected or separate? How can I with my family and society have a good and beautiful life?** 

> What is of greatest and most fundamental value to me and every  human alike? Hence what is most useful for humanity and all life on Earth?

Does sense of oneness provide greater and longer lasting value or sense of separation from the rest? **Is there provision for reality to be how I want it to be, or is there only one Universal Truth applicable everywhere and on everything?** Why am I, my family and humanity not in the state of perfect co-existential Good every day all throughout the day? Why is survival so difficult? Why are we all divided and lacking complete consensus within family and communities? If the existing systems like science, technology, capitalism, consumerism, governments (of any form), religions etc were enough to give us resolution then why does there seem to be no resolution still at micro and macro level? Why is there division, inequality, misery and strife all around since known history? **Why is everyone doings things in order to be happy, but no community, family or individual is ever happy in continuity?**

> What is the resolution that my family, humanity and I need? What is the Universal Order, in which humans can experience co-existential happiness, contentment, peace and bliss in continuity as a tradition forever? **How can I (with my family) realise the purpose of current human lifetime?**

Are we (as my family and society) living in a beautiful and simple present? Are we sowing seeds for a better future for our children, whom we (believe to) love? Or are we sowing seeds of strife, unhappiness and unsustainability? *Are we sure we even realise what happiness, contentment, peace and bliss truly is?* 

> What is the right way to be and live? Does real and deep goodness in life experience, come from the body or the mind? Is it felt alone, or in context of co-existence only? 

#### The essence of Human Life is wisdom and happiness.

Yet, do you find yourself or most of humanity, as resolved and happy? Do you find our current society, system and environment simple, fair and conducive for life? Have you ever felt the need that you need to arrive at the total/objective understanding of reality yourself, and living that way, instead of blindly following someone else or the general social prescription? Do you ever wonder that who else, if not us human beings, are responsible for all existing problems on Earth? *Have you ever wondered what is the solution?* 

Have you ever felt sad when you see the damage has been done to Earth - its air, water and the life on it? Have you ever wondered why do we lack mutual trust, understanding and fulfillment in our relationships - evidenced as broken society and weakening families? Have you ever realised how power and money has become our relegion, and selfishness our instinct, instead of shared happiness and mutual fulfillment? Have you felt sad seeing a war orphaned child or another one starving from hunger, while many of us waste food? Does equality breed higher happiness in society or inequality? Are all humans not equal by the virtue of being human? **Have you ever observed that whether poor or rich, strong or weak, we are happy, content, peaceful and blissful only when we are mentally resolved and share conensus on how to live?** 

> Have you ever thought how much effort we do for survival and comfort of the body, but in comparison we do almost nothing for the mind, for relationships between life to life? Have you ever wondered which is of bigger value - the mind or the body? 

Do you foresee that given the current trend, our grandchildren are going to face even more complications, pain and suffering than us? Do you sometimes wish to pass on a better world to our children than the one we got? **Yet why do you keep repeating the same mistakes and find yourself apathetic to the future of your children?** 

Have you ever felt the need for [a positive and sustainable change](/post/background) within you, within your family and the society? **Have you ever wondered where does the power of right thinking and change lie? Does it lie in external world, society, state or within each family and individual?** Do you wish to be in continuity of resolution, abundance, fearlessness and co-existential fulfilment? Do you wish to experience continuity of happiness, contentment, peace and bliss in your life and relationships? Are you waiting for someone to make the change happen in you, your family and neighborhood? Or are you feeling inspired to be the change you want to see?
