> Many - sequence - arrangement - pattern - system - system and order

*When enough streams join together, they become a large river; large enough to reach the ocean.*
- Anish Joel, [Saadho](http://www.saadho-sangha.org)

*Humanity has arrived at a System which is against Life. There is misery on Earth. No one is really happy - those with power, land or money, and those without. From today's System needs to emerge a System and Order upheld by Realised Consciousness, Universal Values and Mutual Fulfilment; instead of money, power or fear.*

We are in discussions as an international group of philosophers, social activists and reformers, enlightened beings and curious ones. We wish to evolve a new System and Order for enlightened living. Our on ground pilot is happening in Dharamsala area. Your inputs are welcome too. Come meet us, send a mail, call us or share your insights on the online forum called Ashram (coming soon)

## Our approach

- **Understand Life, Living, Existence & Co-existence in an objective way**
  - We will do Existence based human centric contemplation. It will equip us with clarity for every dimension of our life. It is a resolution based understanding of our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems. 
  - We are drawing inspiration from [Co-existentialism](http://www.madhyastha-darshan.info) and all old philosophical traditions, relegions and spiritual teachings.
  - Understand the conceptual, working and operational model for Universal Value based Living and Human Order
- **Apply the conceptual, working and operational models**
  - Conceptual model is about understanding the nature of Life, Existence & Co-existence
  - Working model is [Universal Values based Living](/values)  
  - Physical or operational model covers production, exchange, conservation and right utilisation of resources
  - Families will join the local and global Lifemaker family, by going through [Family education program](/model) and adopting the Value based living.
  - We are documenting these models currently
- **Be a decentralised, equalitarian, global society, organised as locally sustainable ecological communities** 
  - We are focusing on families in our approach since family is the basic unit of well functional society, not the individual.
  - Local (else remote) families must fulfill each other's real needs, as Universal Enlightened Family.
  - We will sustain and produce based on natural farming, eco-businesses/services, living skills and physical work
  - We will co-own, share and utilise land, water, resources and infrastructure *in the right manner*
  - Conduct residential programs for immersive co-living, skills and knowledge sharing
  - Member families in cities can visit, to learn and live by the Lifemaker way, in the context of cities.
- **Connect and cooperate globally as Enlightened Human family**
  - Use online social network (Ashram) and other online resources for getting help, helping, sharing and collaborating remotely.
  - Member families will support each other for health, safety and education.
  - Shape local and global policies, system and order for overall benefit of Lifemaker network, all humanity and all Life on Earth
  - Fund travel expenses for necessary learning or teaching; sustainable infrastructure development
  - Have workshops, programs and events for exposure, skills and knowledge
  - Have registered NGO in India to organise funds, do local pilots and coordinate a global movement
