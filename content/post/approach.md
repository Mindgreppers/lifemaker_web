We are in discussions as an international group evolving the blueprint.
Here is the latest status of this document

## Our eight step approach

- **Meet with an open frame, to understand and See reality (Life, Living, Existence, Co-existence) as-it-is**
  - Attend one of our introductory workshops of 7 days
  - We will do Existence based human centric contemplation. It is an alternative to Materialism/Science and Theism/Spiritualism. It equips us with clarity for every dimension of our lives via realization knowledge. It has a resolution to our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems. 
  - If understood, it will enable a family (together - humanity) to make every relegion successful and our wise ancestors proud.
- **Once the picture is seen in the open frame, start applying the Wisdom in Living** 
  - Identify and serve the *real* needs and spend least on entertainment.
  - Live in a cooperative, complimentary, justful and mutually fulfilling way within the family, and with Earth, Environment and neighborhood.
- **Prove and replicate a standard model for existential and co-existential [education](/model) and [value based co-living](/values)**
  - The family is the fundamental Unit, instead of individual
  - Our package will empower families on health and nutrition, production, exchange, education and enlightenment
  - The package is aimed to help them live in a mutually fulfilling and justful way; within itself and with its neighborhood
  - We are kick-starting from villages of Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. Looking for at least ten local families to opt in, in coming weeks. Once the model kicks in with them, we move forward. 
- **Live at grassroots as land based ecological communities; in symbiosis with each other and all Nature** 
  - Share and utilise land, water and resources in the right manner
  - Be as much locally self-reliant as possible
  - Local families support the need of each other as own
  - Conduct residential programs for immersive co-living, skills and knowledge sharing
  - Member families in cities can also live by the Lifemaker way, in the context of cities.
- **Have complimentary production, exchange and cooperation at local level**
  - Emphasise on Natural farming, eco-businesses/services, living skills and physical work
  - Produce, share and use justfully, and as locally as possible
  - Sustain each other
- **Connect and cooperate globally as Enlightened Human family**
  - Support member families for health, nutrition, prosperity and transformation 
  - Fund travel expenses for learning or teaching; sustainable infrastructure development
  - Develop tools and means for remote collaboration
  - Heal ourselves and all Earth; conserve resources and use rightfully
- **Keep learning and evolving** 
  - Have regular community gatherings to discuss on Life and current state of affairs in Living
  - Use online forum for remote sharing and collaboration.
  - Provide facility for internet access and remote communication
  - Have workshops, programs and events for exposure, skills and knowledge
- **Create a timeless tradition which** 
  - Is proven to ensure continuous happiness and mutual fulfillment for Human society and Earth
  - Is holistic, integral, rational and open
  - Works as a justful and wise system and order.
  - Give every new born child a nurturing environment of happiness in justful co-existence, for as long as humanity lasts (Hopefully much more than a hundred years as some say).
