> Many - sequence - arrangement - pattern - system - system and order

*When enough streams join together, they become a large river; large enough to reach the ocean.*
- Anish Joel, [Saadho](http://www.saadho-sangha.org)

*Humanity has arrived at a System which is against Life. There is misery on Earth. No one is really happy - those with power, land or money, and those without. From today's System needs to emerge a System and Order upheld by Realised Consciousness, Universal Values and Mutual Fulfilment; instead of money, power or fear.*

We are in discussions as an international group of philosophers, social activists and reformers, enlightened beings and curious ones. We wish to evolve a new System and Order for enlightened living. Our on ground pilot is happening in Dharamsala area. Your inputs are welcome too. Come meet us, send a mail, call us or share your insights on the online forum called Ashram (coming soon)

## Our approach

- **Treat family as the unit of society and basis for perpetuating Human seed and realisation**
  - Enlightened families in peaceful and justful co-existence, is healthy and happy Humanity in continuity
- **Understand Life, Living, Existence & Co-existence in an objective way**
  - Curious families will go through [Family education program](/model) and adopting the Value based living.
  - We will do Existence based human centric contemplation. It will equip us with clarity for every dimension of our life. It is a resolution based understanding of our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems. 
  - We are drawing inspiration from [Co-existentialism](http://www.madhyastha-darshan.info) and all old philosophical traditions, relegions and spiritual teachings.
  - Those who have understood will naturally help others understand. 
- **Apply the conceptual, working and operational models that nurture Life and Happiness**
  - Conceptual model covers the understanding of Life, Existence & Co-existence
  - Working model covers [Value based Living](/values)  
  - Physical or operational model covers economics, health, food, environment, production, exchange, conservation, right utilisation of resources and more such things as have to do with physicality of existence
  - These will extend existing socio-economic-political System which provides merely a promise of abundance and wellbeing, but is inherently not capable of doing so.
- **Be a decentralised, sameness based global society, organised as locally sustainable ecological communities** 
  - The network will support each family and child, in living justfully and happy. No one has to struggle alone, or shall be treated that way. 
  - We will sustain and produce based on natural farming, eco-businesses/services, living skills and physical work
  - We will be as decentralised as possible. 
  - Local production and exchange will be of key
  - We will co-own, share and utilise land, water, resources and infrastructure *in the right manner*
  - Conduct residential programs for immersive co-living, skills and knowledge sharing
  - Member families forced to be in cities can visit to learn and live by the Lifemaker way, in the context of cities.
- **Connect and cooperate globally as Enlightened Human family**
  - Use online social network (Ashram) and other online resources for getting help, helping, sharing and collaborating remotely.
  - Shape local and global policies, system and order for overall benefit of Lifemaker network, all humanity and all Life on Earth
  - Fund travel expenses for necessary learning or teaching; sustainable infrastructure development
  - Have workshops, programs and events for exposure, skills and knowledge
