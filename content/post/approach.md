We are in discussions as an international group evolving the blueprint. We wish to evolve a new System and Order for enlightened living.
Here is the latest status of this document

## Our approach

- **Understand Life, Living, Existence & Co-existence in an objective way**
  - We want to understand first, and then work together. Instead of the other way round - live without understanding.
  - We will do Existence based human centric contemplation. It will equip us with clarity for every dimension of our life. It is a resolution based understanding of our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems. 
- **Apply a standard model for [value based co-living](/values) & [family education](/model)**
  - We are going by family based approach. And every child is a child of all member families.
  - After a family has understood what Life is about and how to live, it may join the local and global Lifemaker family, by adopting our way of Life in their living.
  - This model will ensure abundance, wholeseome living and continuity of happiness for member families
- **Be a decentralised, justful society, organised as locally sustainable ecological communities** 
  - Be in good relationship with each other, with Earth and with mutual fulfillment as every family's Dharma
  - Share and utilise land, water and resources in the right manner
  - Have natural and shared abundance instead of individualistic chase for money and survival
  - Sustain and produce based on natural farming, eco-businesses/services, living skills and physical work
  - Local families support the need of each other as own
  - Conduct residential programs for immersive co-living, skills and knowledge sharing
  - Member families in cities can visit to learn and live by the Lifemaker way, in the context of cities.
- **Connect and cooperate globally as Enlightened Human family**
  - Families support families for health, nutrition, prosperity and transformation 
  - Shape local and global policies, system and order for overall benefit of Lifemaker network, all humanity and all Life on Earth
  - Heal ourselves and all Earth; conserve resources and use rightfully
  - Develop tools and means for remote collaboration
  - Fund travel expenses for necessary learning or teaching; sustainable infrastructure development
- **Online plus offline** 
  - Shared facility for internet access and remote communication
  - Have local community gatherings to discuss on Life and current state of affairs in Living
  - Use online forum for global sharing and collaboration.
  - Have workshops, programs and events for exposure, skills and knowledge
