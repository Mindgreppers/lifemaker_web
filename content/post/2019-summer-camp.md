You will feel lightness, love and joy. We will stay for the whole program with continuous meditation as our state of being throughout the day. We will discuss, study and contemplate upon Life, Existence and way to live happily. We will participate in the village living symbiotically.

> Once in a while we will go out for morning walks, day treks or camping in some cave or old forest house in absolute wilderness to experience pure nothingness and everythingness in nature.

#### General schedule

### The content 
> We will explore set of proposals together, through direct experience as meditation and also understanding by the full mind.

What am I? What is Existence? How can I/my family/society be in continuity of happiness and harmony 'as humans'? What is full potential of human life? How to get there? How to differentiate between right (harmonious, fulfilling) and wrong (unharmonious, unfulfilling)? We will discuss, think and understand relevant topics like money, career, entreprenuership, development, evolution, economics, science, technology, abundance, freedom, democracy, power, politics, history, religion, family, villages, society, food, environment, world order, human behavior, future of humanity so on and so forth?

### We want inquisitive travellers, not curious travellers 

> This is a space for sincere self discovery. We will be on a collective cosmic journey to find the truth that is *between, within and all around us*. We want Satsangha - harmonious collaboration for collective inquiry of Truth. We want travellers in this program, not tourists. Travellers go deep into the space they visit. Tourists look for entertainment and photo opportunities. If any mismatch in intention is observed, you will politely be asked to find some other place like Bhagsu or Mcleof to camp where there is plenty of tourists. 


### In pursuit of happiness, satisfaction, peace and bliss! 

We invite you as universal human family to explore with us possibilities of finding 'that' what you need and what you truly seek, what every human seeks deep within - harmony/happiness. We recommend that you come along with at least one more person from your family, couple or friends for better result and taking the learning further, together in your Satsangha. 

{{< figure src="/images/camp-2019/calling-you.jpg" title="Calling you in pursuit of mutual happiness" caption="For us and present and future humanity" height="650" width="500">}}

The camp is for us - our human family - present and future. **We all need to be happy in continuity.** For that to happen we *need* to share same universal realisation and understanding of reality, and thereby co-create a beautiful world together as undivided human family on Earth. This is every human's and humanity's only alternative for assurance of stable goodness in our lives. We wish to manifest a nurturing and enlightening environment and social order that gives an equal opportunity of happy life and abundant living for ourselves, our children, all humanity and every human yet to come.
