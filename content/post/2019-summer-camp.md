### We want not curious tourists, but inquisitive travellers 

> This is not a space for intellectual masturbation and ego games. It is a space for sincere self discovery. We will be on a collective cosmic journey to find the truth that is *between, within and all around us*. We want Satsangha - harmonious collaboration for collective inquiry of Truth. We want travellers in this program, not tourists. If any insincerity is found, you will be asked to go and camp somewhere else like Bhagsu or Mcleod where there is plenty of tourists. 

#### Location 
Life University (Jivan Vidyalaya), village Saalig, Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India.

_Himalayan wilderness, serene and simple village living, futuristic, resolved & universal village and family, togetherness, bliss, dance, music, yoga, question & answer, proposals, discussion, contemplation, meditation, understanding, realisation, resolution & celebration._

### An invitation

We invite you as universal human family to explore with us possibilities of finding 'that' what you need and what you truly seek, what every human seeks deep within - harmony/happiness. We recommend that you come along with at least one more person from your family, couple or friends for better result and taking the learning further, together in your Satsangha. 

> Overall, this experience carries the potential to positively change not only your life, but every-thing that you are connected to and will be, not only as long as you are alive as a human but long after you as human individual, your current family members and current human society are gone from the Earth. 

### The content 
> We will explore set of proposals together.

What am I? How can I/my family/society be in continuity of happiness and harmony? What are our true needs, challenges, problems and their true, holistic and stable solution? What is the description and experience of Existence as co-existence? What are the fundamental laws and constituent parts of existence? What should any, yours and every human family co-create, maintain & pass on to its future generations materially and consciously? What is full potential of human life? How to get there? How to differentiate between right (harmonious, fulfilling) and wrong (unharmonious, unfulfilling)? What about money, career, entreprenuership, development, evolution, economics, science, technology, abundance, freedom, democracy, power, politics, religion, family, villages, society, food, environment, world order, human behavior, future of humanity so on and so forth?

### Why this camp?
The camp is for us - our human family - present and future. **We all need to be happy in continuity.** For that to happen we *need* to share same universal realisation and understanding of reality, and thereby co-create a beautiful world together as undivided human family on Earth. This is humanity's only alternative for assurance of stable goodness in our lives. We wish to manifest a nurturing and enlightening environment and social order that gives an equal opportunity of happy life and abundant living for ourselves, our children, all humanity and every human yet to come.

> Lifemaker, along with some other initiatives in the world, is presenting the holistic knowledge and model for universal human resolution and is a first of its kind to start implementing it on ground in a village. We are looking to share it and gain co-creators and momentum.

As we get closer on our human life journey with same understanding, we will become the first few links of a contagious chain of 'good for all', which has the womb of possibility to form a sequence. From sequences will emerge a pattern, and from patterns across the world will emerge the humanistic system and world order, that has constitution and innateness to last in a sustainable way for as long as humanity lasts on Earth. We envision an order which is wisely implemented, strong and benevolent enough to withstand the test of time and corruption, forever, much beyond our individual lifetimes and selves. Let us think, explore and collaborate together on finding and building on beauty that lasts foreverin our families and the united human family, even long after we are gone from Earth. 

There is so much to know and so much to let go. Then there is lot to do together, which will automatically follow the knowing. This is why are are inviting you to understand with us. In few days we can't expect to know all about our self and the infinite all-that-is. But we will start diving into the dark cave of our inner being and perhaps we will find light at the very bottom of it. And perhaps, just perhaps, that light will shine ever more bright within us from there on.

### The host team
The program is being conducted by residents of village Saalig, under guidance from Ayush. 

**Ayush will guide you through a deep and holistic exploration** through darshana (philosophy), discussion/QnA, contemplation & meditation. These sessions are aimed to give answers with evidence at both, conscious and material plane of existence as co-existence. He will conduct discussions and practice sessions around self realisation of co-existence, human centeric view of co-existence, art of breathing, living etc. Ayush is an entrepreneur, computer engineer, software architect and full stack product and UX developer by profession. He teaches village children, youth and families about Life and also living skills. He facilitates the Lifemaker program in village Saalig. He also happens to be a budding vocalist, flutist, artist and a radio jockey. He will be the one to present to you the holistic view of everything from life to Lifemaker. 

> You should check his podcast [here](https://www.anchor.fm/ayush-ghai), where he is talking about these subjects only, these days! He can be found on [Facebook](/www.facebook.com/ayush-ghai).

**Surinder** an organic farmer, shopkeeper and social worker of village Saalig, also part of Lifemaker society, will take us for a trek or overnight camp in higher wilderness. He also happens to be the operations manager of our Dharamsala Lifemaker program. He will share his vision for village Saalig and the world. **Ahilya Devi** the matriach from the village who has been into serving village for more than 30 years and currently runs self help groups of more than 60 women. **Shobha didi** from Nepal will share her motivational life story as a woman on the journey of breaking societal fears and standing on her own feet while also helping other. She runs the wool knitting self help group. 

### About Saalig
Saalig also happens to be Lifemaker's seed village for the model of Awakened Self-reliance as universal human tradition on Earth. You will get to see the Lifemaker model growing as a sapling on the ground here. We will see the village program. Meet the engaging families and children of our Life Gurukul program. We will have a cultural and knowledge exchange with this village, which we envision to put on the world map as the first village to get started on the model of perfected human co-existence.

### Stay
Stay is in the Life Gurukul space hosted in an old mud house, under restoration. The toilet is shared with the neighbor. Bath will be outdoor - either in the river or with the tap. For women and those with special needs, couple of indoor toilet and bath at Ayush's house are available with western commode and hot water shower. For families in need of a separate stay with attached toilet because of some physical ailment, we will try to arrange stay in Ayush's house or some other house in the village on a best effort basis.
For bathing, we recommend that the nearby stream is a good place to take a dip in the summer afternoon.
