### The pilot village Saalig and area Dharamsala, Kangra


Saalig is a typical Himachali village located one hour drive from the main Dharamsala center. Ayush has been living here since 2017. Being himself on the the journey of understanding and realization, and dedicated to cause of undivided society and heaven on Earth, he has shared his (growing) understanding of the human resolution (Samadhaan) with his friends and neighbours in the village. They have found the proposals verifiable, meaningful, inspiring and worth discussing with the larger village family. We have held some public meetings and various private exchanges in pairs and groups. Even the children have been part of it through an after school program. Today Swarajya is an increasingly recurring keyword in the discussion between the community here. 

With your blessings, a village hopes to establish a shared understanding based team of inspired volunteers from the village and outside society, to implement the proposed working model and share its fruits within the village and with the rest of the world. They wish to partner with the larger undivided society to use shared resources, talents and technology to spread the message far and wide; educate themselves and larger society; come together, collaborate, exchange with shared understanding; self govern with a system which nurtures holistic human wellbeing. They wish to see a wave of model villages and neighborhoods show up in the Indo-Tibet-Butan society in the coming 5 - 10 years, with a universal blueprint, value system and system of good governance.

The total resolution for Manav Swarajya (enlightened humane self governance in coexistence) is expected since time immemorial to shine forth from the Indian subcontinent for the whole world to see. It is a promise of light from the land of sages to the rest of the society. The human society is yet to witness a village or nation state that lives like this. Will the expectation finally be fulfilled in the 21st century? As you well know, time is ticking by for humankind. Will is our duty, responsibility and role in realizing this?

### Dharamsala, Kangra, Himachal - a fertile ground
The surrounding area (Dharamsala, Kangra) is rich in forests and biodiversity. It is mostly a rural region and is also witnessing modern “development”. The native families here still do farming and shepherdry. Tourism and spiritual/religious/nature travel is one of the main sources of monetary income for this society. This region also hosts the Tibetan Budhdhist community, to whom many international seekers come for answers to the pertinent questions. The traveler circuit here includes not only holiday goers but also a significant number of Hindu and Budhdhist devotees, lovers of life, nature and seekers of universal knowledge. There is a growing multi talented expat community in this region. With understanding, guidance, collaboration and motivation from the rest of the world family, as a melting pot, Dharamsala is truly a fertile ground full of immense possibilities as an epicenter for bringing the much awaited light of human resolution to the world.
