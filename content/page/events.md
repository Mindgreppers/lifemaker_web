In our workshops we provide homely environment with nutritious food. We also arrange for comfortable stay nearby, since we don't have our space yet. Ours is an environment of safety/wellbeing/trust (Satsangha), discussions, study, contemplation and meditation. We try to objectively understand the fundamental nature of existence, human being and conduct of humaneness.

*You will require preliminary registration of at least two members from a family. Please contact us through [Lifeline](/lifeline) for the same.*
