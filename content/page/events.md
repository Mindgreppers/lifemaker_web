If you curious and wish to explore more with us, you will have to visit us or invite us to your place, for a workshop or retreat of minium 5 days.

In our workshops we provide homely environment with nutritious food. We also arrange for comfortable stay nearby, since we don't have our space yet. Ours is an environment of safety/wellbeing/trust (Satsangha), discussions, study, contemplation and meditation. We try to objectively understand the fundamental nature of the Universe, the Human Being and consciousness. It is relaxing and deeply engaging. We invite your family to dive deep within with full focus.

> Our only request is to come only if there is sincere curiousity, to understand Life in **an open frame**, live that way and see what happens!

*We let participants know the cost incurred per person, when they are registering. In case you are not financially able to cover your cost, let us know at the time of registration and the larger family will try to help as possible. You will require preliminary registration of at least two members from a family. Please contact us through [Lifeline](/lifeline) for the same.*
