If you curious and wish to explore more with us, please visit us or invite us to your place.

In our workshops we provide homely environment with nutritious food. We also arrange for comfortable stay nearby, since we don't have our space yet. Ours is an environment of safety/wellbeing/trust (Satsangha), discussions, study, contemplation and meditation. We try to objectively understand the fundamental nature of existence, human being and conduct of humaneness. 

> Our only request is to come only if there is sincere curiousity, to understand Life in **an open frame**, live that way and see what happens!

*You will require preliminary registration of at least two members from a family. Please contact us through [Lifeline](/lifeline) for the same.*
