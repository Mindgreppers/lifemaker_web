If you have recently found yourself questioning about reality, Life, Universe, happiness etc., it may be worthwhile to visit us for 7 days. We will provide food and stay arrangements in a loving and trusting atmosphere (satsangha), along with discussions, study, contemplation and meditation, on the fundamental nature of the Universe, the Human Being and consciousness. We invite your family to discuss and contemplate with us in *an open frame*, on how to live mutually fulfilled and happy, on a continuous and spontaneous basis, in justful symbiosis with co-existence.

> Our only request is to come only if there is sincere curiousity, to understand Life in **an open frame**.

*All workshops are free and require preliminary registration of at least two members from a family. Please contact us through [Lifeline](/lifeline) for the same.*
