## Three kinds of Lifemaker members

While we are talking of members as individuals here, we are in reality rcruiting families! Families are our favorite target audience, because in togetherness is the living proof of the individual's realisation and happiness. And also, most of us feel most comfortable and at home, with our families which provide us the nurturing environment to grow.  

#### Elders (or Budhdhas)

By elders we mean the Self realised souls, who shine forth with unblemished illumination of the Revelation. They are pure primordial consciousness manifest in human form between us, like the Buddha. Lifemaker has the blessing to have some truly Wise â€“ Realised and Selfless souls, living in infinitude, here to guide and advice us as senior family members. 

#### Seekers (or seeders)
The seeders are seeking continuous happiness and abundance in life. They are here with their families, as part of our Universal family, to make this project a reality. Seeders are helping us by donating funds, spreading the word or doing different kinds of Lifemaker work like developing the design and technology for our upcoming apps, or hosting workshops.

#### Experts
As Lifemakers, we wish to be available to humanity to help them do well in any aspect of existence. From the dot (the Self, Consciousness) to the circle (life activities, co-existence). Everyone has something to share. If you are good at something, anything, and wish to share the same for others' benefit, please get in touch with us. Read more about the skills we currently have in the [Lifeline section](/lifeline) But really, we are happy to add your unique skill to the list. It could be making paper toys to rockets that go to Mars. Anything that can be useful for someone can be listed as our skills.
