We envision, in next few years, a positive paradigm shift in human consciousnessness and state of individual and collective affairs. We will face tought times because of our past actions or natural disasters, but with help of each other, we will do well overall. Average human will be happier, more loved and more resourceful than today.

We will move from egoism, separationism and conflict, to love, inclusion and singularity. Reorganising ourselves under a more compassionate, sensible and decentralise collaboration, we will flourish along with nature. A new era of international cooperation and symbiotic lifestyle will unleash, Through mutual sharing of abundance, there will be abundance of food, resources and creative opportunities for everyone. Our children will be more connected with nature, both within and without. They will be more empathising and supportive, rather than being competitive, judgemental or envious. Our hearts and minds will be open. We envision no need for huge army or border control. We envision equal rights for animals and plants as for humans. We envision all around happiness, peace and self realisation. Free from worries or fears about present or future, each human soul will unleash its true creative potential for the benefit of World.
