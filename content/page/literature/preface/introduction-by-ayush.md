My dear curious one

I have been waiting for you to arrive at this page. My name is Ayush and for the time being, I am the sole author of the essays listed below, touching upon the essence of Life, Existence and undivided, happy and prosperous Human Society. I have been through (a still ongoing) cosmic and very human journey of reunion with the source and in my inquisitive explorations have found universally acceptable answers (resolution) to some important questions pertaining to human existence on Earth. My teachers and the works of many our ancestors and currently living human beings has been of invaluable help. Thanks to the collective effort by human species, we now have the full and final universal perspective of Self, Existence and human values and also the resolution to all human needs available to us. Here I share the same with you. Hope you enjoy the read, find it meaningful and send us feedback.

The literature is work in progress. Our intention is to keep the information shared here to be universally verifiable simple perspective of reality. It will take a collective effort for it to get completed. These is so much to talk about! These few articles are not even the tip of the iceberg. But they should be fine as a foundational start for the curious one. Also, the belief is that this literature of Lifemaker will forever be evolving, becoming better, thanks to our children and grand children who will continue to improve it even long after you and I are gone from the face of Earth. 

> If you wish to send us an essay, we will be happy to curate and upload it here with your reference. Remember, this is an of, by and for society project.

There will be some points in this literature that will resonate with you and some points that may not. Your response is not only welcome but also very desirable for not only it will help us connect, it will also open the channel for mutual learning and making the common charter more complete and sound. We are all on the path of learning and knowledge is the prize. Since the reality in which we all exist is the same, its knowledge is the same. And that is the uniting factor humanity needs - knowledge on which we are united by shared understanding. 

At Lifemaker our pursuit is universal knowledge for all humanity - an understanding of reality acceptable to any human. We wish the charter to always include things which are verifiable by observation through the body, understandable by the eye of the mind and acceptable to the heart.

These essays will explore different aspects of Life, Existence and living. It will give insights into why and how to organise as Undivided Human Society living in an order of perfection, maintaining an environment of unity, love, trust, balance and wisdom - on Earth, and beyond. 

May you enjoy the reading.

Be blessed.
