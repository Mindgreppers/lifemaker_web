**We believe [family education](/model) is the way to educate our selves, and bring forth a new System and Order.**
By family, we mean *at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment.* Family is the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living. **An integrated, enlightened and healthy family is the basic unit for an integrated, enlightened and healthy human society.**

The family based approach consists of five main components.

- satsang - a mutually fulfilling environment providing nutrition, safety and love where every member feels trust and emotional wellbeing
- discussion - in Satsang, we mutually discuss how can wellbeing and safety be achieved in a jutsful way
- study - how to be and do, with happiness and not for happiness. How can this state of happiness change from being initially repetitive to ultimately continous. 
- contemplation - understanding of entire existence with all its objects including nature of individual self *in thoughts*
- meditation - being and experiencing the entire existence with all its objects including nature of individual self *in void or silence*
