In here are to be found various essays touching upon the essence of Life, Existence and Lifemaker. 

The literature is work in progress. It will take some time till it matures. And the belief is that it will forever be evolving, becoming better. 

There will be some points in this literature that will resonate with you and some points that may not. Your response is not only welcome but also very desirable for not only it will help us connect, it will also open the channel for mutual learning and making the common charter more complete and sound. We are all on the path of learning and knowledge is the prize. Since the reality in which we all exist is the same, its knowledge is the same. And that is the uniting factor humanity needs - knowledge on which we are united by shared understanding. 

At Lifemaker our pursuit is universal knowledge for all humanity - an understanding of reality acceptable to any human. We wish the charter to always include things which are verifiable by observation through the body, understandable by the eye of the mind and acceptable to the heart.

These essays will explore different aspects of Life, Existence and living. It will give insights into why and how to organise as Undivided Human Society living in an order of perfection, maintaining an environment of unity, love, trust, balance and wisdom - on Earth, and beyond. 

May you enjoy the reading.
