The universal perspective of Existence as Co-existence, Self as Human and the working model of Undivided Society is greatly derived from, but not limited to, [Madhyastha Darshan](http://www.madhyasth-darshan.info) - a take at universal explanation of Existence in a human centric way and the solution to all human needs and problems.
