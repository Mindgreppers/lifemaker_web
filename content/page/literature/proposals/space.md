## Space or Void or Shoony (Hindi)

* Space is infinite energy in eternal equilibrium 
* Because it is in permanent equilibrium, it is static; i.e. has no activity of its own.
* 
* It is transparent (does not affect any thing), omnipresent (present everywhere, even where there is no unit of Nature) and transcendental (is required for the units of Nature to coexist)
* Space is the (fundamental) field of which all fields, whether material or conscious, are part.
