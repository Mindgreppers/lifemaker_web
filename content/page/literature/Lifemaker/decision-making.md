## The structure and decision making of undivided human society

> All changes to vision, constitution, policies, memberships, working decisions & problem resolutions shall be done with consensus from bottom up through _fractal design based self governing setup_. At every level of the fractal, not more than 10-12 people will be involved in making decisions, with full trust and go ahead by the levels below.

A family is a group of upto around 10 people, and will choose one member to represent it in its neighborhood family group in which upto around 10 families will participate, as a larger family. Such family groups at village level will send one representative up to the village family level. The village groups will each send one representative to the district family level, so and so forth till the world family level where in the end around ~ 10 most wise, capable and trusted people will have boiled up from grassroots to top, _all through consensus and trust based decision making_.

> Any two humans are united in right, and divided only in wrong (i.e. atleast one of them is acting rigidly by wrong assumptions).

If ever at any level, a group is not able to arrive at consensus on any issue, the represenatative's decision shall be consensually, peacefully accepted by the members. A group will only be divided in wrong, and united in right. Under exceptional situations when there is indecisiveness, the representative will break the tie, after listening to all the members of their group. Since the representative is an intimate member of their group of around 10, and is chosen by the group with consensus, the group members will have put trust in the wisdom and good intention of the person chosen, from deep within. Additionally, the representative may seek advice from neighboring councils or higher councils or advisors chosen by their council, to feel confident about the choice to be made. This way everything that the society does will have agreement of every individual and group of the society from bottom up. This way, the society will also be able to handle conflicts and ensure justice (all round fulfillment vs. punishment) without going to the courts.

> Society will self govern itself based on wisdom, trust, consensus and power will serve wisdom.

### Traditional governance structures are yet to deliver total success

Traditional governance structures like kingship, religion, autocracy, communism, socialism and even democracy have failed to deliver on the promise of happiness and prosperity for the common human family, as a social order. Even democratically run countries are full of division, mismanagement, poor decision making, unpredictability and strife.

Why? Because democracy also runs by power and not wisdom. Those who get most votes come to power. The design of democracy by default divides the society into factions and parties. What we need and want is Undivided Human Society. 

> Another issue faced historically with all governance models is that the decisions for local people are made by few people sitting thousands of kilometers away from the local problem and needs. The solution is to provide the local families freedom of justful self governance and also responsible control, nurture and right utilization of local resources.
