As previously discussed there are as many truth sets as number of people, animals or conscious beings in existence. Now let me ask you to think about _that_ which exists before any human or animal came into existence. That part of picture in which all reality is based upon is something which is apriori to all beings or seers that exist. That, which is trasnscendental to every thing that exists is the apriori Truth.

> The apriori reality is the fundamental reality. The apriori part of reality is like deep deep ocean with absolute stillness and everything else is like a wave in it.

_For any human it is important to think about the sea in which everything exists_. This sea is the sea of consciousness. It is what was often referred to as God. It is infinite energy. It is the basis upon which everything exists. 

### Reality has certain rules to which every thing whether material or conscious, is bound

Gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear forces, quantum fields, consciousness - everything interacts with each other based on certain rules. No one can break those rules. The rules of reality are universally applicable at every corner of the infinite existence.

While every seer has its own belief system on how reality is & what he is, there is ONE TRUTH which encompasses all the truths within it. That truth is existence or absolute reality itself. _Every atom is composed by the same fundamental principles and so is every human._  

## Every healthy human has a mind capable of full realisation of the apriori truth

The truth which is same to all is bound to be realised in the same way only by any seer, upon FULL SEEING. Seeing does not mean seeing by the body's eyes or senses. _Seeing means seeing with the mind's eye._ When you add one and one it becomes two only. Any child when it learns to count is bound to arrive at the same answer. Same way every human when he or she uses their FULL MIND without fixation on pre-existing faith or belief systems, they are bound to come to same conclusions. Reality is simple to comprehend if presented simply, sweetly and if inquired upon with real thirst to _know it._ 

## The only way to arrive at consensus is to inquire with an open mind and happy heart

Inquiry into truth can not happen with frustration. The moment a realisation of any part of truth happens peace comes with it. Knowledge of the paiori truth always brings peace, happiness, bliss, contentment with it. Any fact which is not bringing upon these features into daily living are not based on truth, _for realisation of the apriori truth is always sweet._ 

## Apriori truth is sweet and its knowledge satisfying
This statement can be experitientially verified by upon _sincere inquiry._ Sincere inquiry which is bereft of agenda is the only way to arrive at real knowledge which is sweet and satisfying. This sweetness is experienced by the heart (the very source or center) of you. When the heart is feeling happiness or bliss upon a realisation, that realisation is useful for you. 

> Truth or knowledge of reality is the most and only useful thing that exists

Reality is useful because you exist only in reality. Knowledge is reality itself. You become what you really _know_. Hence knowledge of reality is as useful as reality itself. 

The use of untruth or false knowledge is only to make you realise the need of realisation of true knowledge. Ignorance is bliss they say, but is it really? The use of any conflict is to help you learn about how existence works. No human in sane senses loves to be in conflict. When you know how things work, you know how to make best use of your knowledge to live happily and satisfied. If you don't know how things work you will be unsure how to move and unstable in your belief sets. You will not be able to make the most out of human existence. 

Imagine is scientific knowledge did not always lead to the same answer or observation everytime an experiment is done, we would not have been able to make any invention that is useful to humanity or the world. Scientists have been able to send intergalactic missions based on precise knowledge of gravity and other forces. If you did not know that water quenches thirst you would perhaps have died from thirst. If you knew that violence is not the way to help someone understand what you want them to understand, you would have used mechanisms that work - like patience, sweetness and love. The more you share same understanding in any relationship, more is success in the relationship. Simpley knowing that my relationship needs same understanding helps you move towards greater understanding and better relationship experience.

## Knowledge helps you live with happiness, satisfaction, peace and bliss
Lack of knowledge can allow for temporary relief at best. For permanent resolution any two humans need knowledge. More the knowledge less the strife and more the ease and goodness in living. 

## Believe only what you know and get to know what you have believed.
Don't believe anything that is said even here without your personal verification. Know that knowing is not limited to only the mind. Knowing is full with the stamp of approval by the heart. Knowing starts from the mind and culminates in the heart. It happens so deep in the heart that it feels as if even the blood and bones are resonating with what you really know by your very own experience and understanding. So when you as a human have capability to know the reality as-it-is like every other human why not use the gift that you have?
