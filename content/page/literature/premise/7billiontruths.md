> **What we can perhaps all agree is that our individual truth sets are based entirely on how useful we find them in our lives**

Every person holds their own truth set which holds true in their world view. This consists of two main components - faith and belief.

## Faith is based on following 

Faith statements are followed based on reality assumed to hold true without self inquiry. Typically they are followed because someone held in high esteem by the person has spoken them. For example, parents, teacher, a religious leader, culture etc. A typical faith statement would be "Following this religious practice is the one and only way to get to heaven." Or "Infinite profit based capitalism is good for humanity"

## Belief is based on direct knowledge
Belief is based on seer's own direct experience, inquiry and realisational knowledge. For example, 
"Water is transparent in color"
"Sun always rises in the East"
"Earth attracts objects towards itself"

Such statements are verifiable by even a little child on his own. He doesn't need anyone to tell them this. _Beliefs carry 100% confidence because they are seen to hold true everytime the observation is made._

> Every person and animal has their own truth set. And all of these truth sets coexist in existence. Hence 7 billion people, 7 billion truth sets.
