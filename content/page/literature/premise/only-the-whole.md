## A part can not realise the nature of the whole

Just like 1 can never comprehend 2, the mind alone can not comprehend the nature of Self (or Life) because it is only a part of Life and not the whole of Life.

> There is something deeper than the mind - it is that part of the Self which is _'experiencing'_ everything - the body, the world, the mind and even itself. This is the part which is experiencing the deep sleep and as well the dreams and awake experience. This is the part from which the mind emerges. This part is the mediating activity between rest of co-existence and the mind. It is the screen upon which all perception and mental activity takes place. We can call it the soul or the heart or the center of Self. Heart is the deepest part of the Self. The heart is the experiencer, the observer, the expressor. 

Only together, the mind and soul can fully realise the nature of Life and reality. Until then the knowledge is only partial. Soul's knowledge is of bigger impact than pure mental knowledge because soul is the heart of the Self and the mediator of the Self within all of existence as co-existence. Soul is what is experiencing even the mind. Mind can not touch directly the soul because the soul is "apriori" to the mind, but mind can comprehend the soul and feel its presence. If the Self is like an atom, then the soul is the nucleus and the mind is the layers of electron like particles revolving around the soul.

Haven't you ever experienced knowing something so surely in your heart that you don't even need to think about it. Your heart 'feels and knows'. Your mind tries to comprehend how what-you-know by heart makes sense but it can not fully grasp the explanation yet. For example, knowing that your father is about to arrive in five minutes even though you can't explain how and why you know it? 

Sometimes it happens the other way round. Your mind grasps a concept, is able to verify it as a fact and then the comprehension resonates with your heart. For example, 1 + 1 is 2. When you understand how this works, your heart accepts the reality too.

The trouble of an unevolved Life is that it lives by using only half of its capability. It uses only the outer parts of its mind, never reaching the deeper parts to contemplate, understand and realise reality. The functioning of outer layers of mind is limited to hoping, making choices, tasting, thinking, comparison, analysis, desiring, visualisation etc. Contemplation and full comprehension of anything rarely happens. The heart is even less touched upon as if almost inert. It is said of some poeple "He doesn't have a soul." Technically, it means "his soul is inert in this moment".


###### Mind, Soul and knowledge

Now, I would like to talk a little about the necessity and also the limit of intellectual argumentation. It is important to realise the usefulness and as well the limitation of the mind. Philosophy and science serve a useful purpose by helping intellectualise and contemplate upon Self and Existence. But since mind is only a part of the Self, it can not realise the nature of the whole Self by itself. By the same virtue of being part of the whole Self, mind is also necessarily required for full realisation. **All of the whole is needed to realise the nature of the whole**. Hence philosophy, science, maths and physics as tools are useful and necessary too, but they are not enough alone nor are they absolute as they are tools of the mind only. 


Till the heart has not realised the nature of existence and experienced the bliss of knowledge, everything is mere mental concept & information and not true knowledge. Till the soul is not fully realised Life does not experience peace, contentment and bliss, and does not exhibit consistency of 'moral' living, positivism and inspiration in continuity. It is not able to do what it feels is right. There is conflict both inside and in relationship with the world. It is so because the soul is the center of Life, the real experiencer and the mediating activity between Life's mind, body and rest of co-existence.

When realisation of nature of Self and existence as co-existence happens, it is felt by all the layers of the mind and right through to the heart. In that moment the whole of Self knows, that it knows. And there is bliss! The attestation by the heart is joined by full mental clarity and resolution. When the heart knows and the mind understands, there is no scope of any doubt left whatsoever. When the heart is realised as well the mind has full comprehension of the realisation, Life has achieved its full evolution. There is eternal happiness, peace, contentment and bliss because the mind is fully resolved for permanence and all unecessary desires, hopes and thoughts have come to an end for good. There is stability in thought, work and behavior. Full realisation is the end of all conflict and suffering. It is the beginning of an eternal status of pure blissful existence and co-existence. 

> Full realisation of all-that-is is Budhahood and only the whole of the Self (the soul and the mind together) can realise the whole of the Self and its inseparable relationship with the whole of Existence.
