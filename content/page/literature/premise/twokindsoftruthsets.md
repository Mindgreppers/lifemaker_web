> Every person has universal and irrevocable right to hold on to their truth set. They must surely find their truth as useful to them. Because truth is meant to be useful. The day a person realises that their some part of their truth set is not useful for their happiness or growth, their truth set evolves to be even more useful.

So we can say there are two kinds of truth sets in the world. 

## Truth sets which are not useful
This category of truth sets don't provide the seer or their relations with continuity of happiness, contentment, peace and bliss. These are typically constrictive not allowing to add on more truth sets. These don't provide stable basis of choice making across every situation. The persons holding them behave in contradictory ways in different situations and contexts. They also don't provide stability of goodness inside that person or in their world. These truth sets are not very useful if the person carefully observes the allround quality of their life and living.

## Truth sets which are useful
This category of truth sets provides the seer and their relations with increasing repetition or continuity of happiness, contentment, peace and bliss. They are stable. They allow flexibility & expansion to be become more and more useful truthsets as they grow.

**Exercise: If we were to choose a stand on which to live by, what would be most useful?**

- I live by my own truth set and reject the others
- I live by my own truth set and let others live by theirs.
- My truth set is integral of every truth set that exists. Every new perspective is a gift for me and it holds true. When someone says sky is vilet, I say "Aha, the sky is violet in one of the infinite world views!"
