# What is existence?

_Existence is all-that-is. Existence itself is co-existence. Existence is inseparable, indivisible, absolute. Existence itself is truth, knowledge, reality, actuality._

Existence is one and only. There is no 'peer’ or other outside existence. There is no 'creator' outside of existence for where would the creator exist if not inside existence?

#### Existence itself is God.

_Existence is all there is to know. Existence is the total object of knowing._

**Why does existence exist?** There is no point in thinking about it for if existence were not there there would be no one to think about it. Nor is this question necesary for our happiness. We just know that _Existence is._ 

**Does existence have a start or end?** Existence is infinite and eternal. Parts of nature have a start or an end. 

> **All of existence is energy only. Energy is of two kinds - in equilibrium and seeking equilibrium.** 

When the constitution of existence is looked upon, all its parts are seen to co-exist in an _inseparable way_ because existence can't be divided. The main two components of existence as co-existence are [Void](/literature/void) and [manifest energy](/literature/manifest-energy). 

### Void: The energy in equilibrium

There is an infinite and all-pervasive field of unmanifest energy in all round equilibrium and equal density everywhere. Not a “seer”, not a “doer”, not an “experiencer”, not a “creator”, not a “director”, this infinite energy in equilibrium does not, can not “do” anything. Yet as the fundamental basis of Existence, it is the 'field' in which rest of co-existence exists. It allows, empowers, connects and _mediates_ between all free energy and matter in co-existence. This field is the fundamental basis of all existence as co-existence. It can be called [Void, space or omnipotence](/literature/void). 

### Nature: The manifest energy seeking equilibrium

Now, within the infinite energy at equilibrium (Void) there exists manifested energy "not in equilibrium" which is constantly flowing across difference in potential. Manifest energy is eternally seeking equilibrium (also stated as second law of thermodynamics in science). Hence material world or "Nature" is always changing. 

_All nature (manifest energy including you and me) is but vibrations, disturbances or variations in the field of Void_. Sometimes these disturbances are flowing and sometimes these are tied together in condensed form. When they are tied together in condensed form - that is matter. 
Matter is manifested energy condensed together. All matter in nature exists in three different forms 

- inert matter like atoms, elements & molecules
- living matter composed of inert matter, like plants, bacteria, animal body, human body or another kind of body. All living bodies ingest, transform, use and expel energy (metabolism).
- Conscious matter (Life) like you, me all humans and animals with a brain, senses and nervous system. Life co-exists with a body. It desires, thinks, learns in one lifetime, does things consciously.

### Life: the conscious observer and experiencer of existence
Manifest energy constantly undergoes development, shifting through infinite forms, combinations and permutations. There comes a state when a unit of energy becomes conscious of its presence in the Void. In that moment that unit of energy undergoes a change in its manifestation from inert physical energy to conscious energy. It shifts to some _immaterial_ fields in Void where it is not affected by forces of physical fields like electromagnetic, gravitational fields etc. But it can still connect with and affect matter and energy in physical fields. Material energy gets assembled around itself instantaneously as a body, to experience and interact with existence. That is the birth of Life. Life can also be called a [conscious atom](/literature/consciou-atom) like you and me.

## Co-existence
The infinite field of Void is an inseparable amalgamation of many kinds of fields. Some fields are purely physical. Some allow active consciousness. Nature is disturbance in these fields. The disturbance can shift from one field to another thus taking another manifestation. For example, light energy can convert to electrochemical energy or heat. Manifest energy has infinite manifestations starting from atoms and subatomic particles of different kinds. All of these manifestations are co-dependent on each other. Every atom has an effect howsoever small, on every other atom in existence and is affected by all of the rest of co-existence in turn. Same for every human. Every _thing_ depends on everything else in co-existence. 

The moment there is an atom in Void, there is co-existence. The moment existence is seen as its parts the parts are seen to be co-dependent, complimentary and co-existing. All the fields co-exist, atoms co-exist, you co-exist, I co-exist. Speaking of Life, every Life co-exists with body. Body is co-existence of multiple layers ranging from gross physical to subtle energetic, lower mental, upper mental and causal bodies. Every two humans are co-existing together. There is co-existence between the seer and the seen too. Existence is energy is all-that-is. But when seen as constituent parts all of existence is co-existence. Nature in Void is co-existence. Nature within itself is co-existence. Co-existence is the infinite and eternal play between fields of various kinds.

## Everythig is connected, co-dependant and complimentary

There is nothing in the entire existence, which exists alone. Not even the Void. Every particle has an effect on every corner of the infinite existence and is affected by every other particle.

So then why does Life feel or act separate from the rest when in reality Life IS NOT SEPARATE from the rest. When you will live with awareness of the Void you will feel the oneness of all-that-is. Tthe Void being the all encompassing field in which every thing is soaked, dipped and surrounded, allows everything to exist as unified, "One and Only" existence. This oneness is Love. Void itself is love. All energy is love. Existence is knowledge is truth is energy is love.

### Contemplative meditation on co-existence

> **In the Void, with rest of the co-existence, I am.**

With your attention sticking to this statement for long enough see whether or not it makes you feel true connectedness with everything else. See if it makes you feel infinite just like the Void. See how it takes you to transcendence. See how it brings pure joy inside of you! :)
