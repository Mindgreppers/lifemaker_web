## The human problem

> Our society and most of its individuals and families are not living freely, fearlessly, happily, harmoniously or mutually fulfilled, at least not all the time, if not most of the time. 

We are suffering from never ending strife, misunderstanding, miscommunication, division, conflict and misery at all scopes of human existence - within Self, families, neighborhoods, regions, humankind and with rest of Nature. 

Till date humankind has not been able to establish a self sustaining, familial and social order and environment, such that it fosters continuity of true liberation, happiness and fulfillment within each individual, family and all its relationships - from physical family, to village, to neighborhood, region, state, to the World Family.


## The universal human need

> Every human wants to feel fulfillment, happiness, peace, harmony _within its Self and with rest of the World, all the time_. _No matter what_ the belief is, situation is, expectation is or decision is, every human is ultimately seeking the same in every "here and now".

## The opportunity, the challenge

* To unite and live harmoniously, compassionately and prosperously as ONE World Family, as per the natural laws of Existence and the way we are actually, as human beings.
*  To establish and sustain justful and resolved family as the unit of undivided society. To ensure each human family lives justfully with resolution for their material and conscious needs and responsibilities, lives happily and prosperously, in harmony with rest of human family & nature.
* To collectively and consensually establish, upkeep and live by a timeless tradition of self governance (Swarajya) which works in a fractal way of self governance from bottom up - from family, to village, to state to world family, based on Universal understanding of Self as human, Existence as Co-existence, and universal human values. 
* To understand & live by a social working model which is naturally acceptable to every human alike, is _guaranteed to satisfy_ all human needs & aspirations over all time to come (from material to consciuous, individual to physical family to neighborhood to world family, human to nature) and helps humanity realise and demonstrate the full potential of being human.

## The six dimensional working model

To establish and maintain family and grassroots based tradition of happy, prosperous, peaceful and harmonious self governance, covering broadly the aspects of 
* human values development education (or Life education) and research
* health and lifestyle
* ecology friendly production and services
* local circular exchange and economy
* justice (everyone's fulfillment) and celebration
* nurture of nature and conservation & right utilization of all resources.
