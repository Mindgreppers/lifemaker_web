## What is family

A family doesn't have to be necessary blood related or headed by a married couple of different sex. As long as a family lives justfully within itself, with society and nature, the form of family and parenthood can be as varied as nature. Such a family, of any composition and relational combination as mutually constituted by its consenting members will be acceptable to undivided society (world family).

A family is a group of people living together with strong bond of love and trust, feeling assured of care, protection & nurture, expect happiness, peace, contentment & bliss with each other, share common vision, projects and intention for lifetime (like living happily together, raising children, making a home etc.) and are resolved and committed to make it happen responsibly.

> The building brick of undivided human society is a family committed to living justfully between its members and with the rest of society and world. Since family is the fundamental unit of of human society and the first and primary space for trust, love, nurture, education and wellbeing, the universal solution is based on family as the unit of society.
