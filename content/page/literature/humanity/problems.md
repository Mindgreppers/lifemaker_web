# Past: 20th century AD and before
## Not so bad
### Humans still learning and adapting to nature 
* More physical work to do.
* Less comfortable physical existence in terms of housing, clothing, heating, energy, health facility, food production etc. 
* Higher mortality risk. Attack from animals. Climate. Weather. Diseases. Not such a developed surgery and medical system in west. But there was Ayurveda and chi gung in East.
* Uncleanliness and hygene

## The ugly
### Problems faced by humans between humans
* Communalism and division between human to human
* Attack from each other - loot, crimes and war
* Ruled by power and fear - State, Religion

## The good
### The good in the past
* For every human the world was full of wonders to be discovered! 
* Joy of abundant natural living and first hand knowledge of nature
* Joy of co-existence, social company and codependence
* Joy of hard work, fitness & strength of physical bodies and healthy eating
* Joy of simple living
* Joy of healthy air, water and earth

> ALL THAT GOOD IS MOSTLY GONE NOW OR GOING!

# Present: In 20th and 21st century

## Really bad and dangerous at mass scale
### Problems faced with nature:
* Massive reduction in natural life on Earth
* Dwindling natural resources
* Pollution in rivers, oceans, land, air
* Global warming
* Increasing unsustainability of the planet for all Life include humanity

## Ugly still and even more dangerous 
### Problems faced within
* Communalism and division between human to human
* Attack from each other - loot, crimes and war
* Refugee crisis
* Ruled by power and fear - Secondary become state & religion and the rule is NOW by Capitalism
* Education is feeding illusion and creating mindless machines instead of mindful humans
* Economic bubble & inequality: profit mentality, hollow & infinite growth spiral, interest based economy
* Consumerism: Life is more disconnected with society, land & nature
* More dependence on currency for survival than real nature, human knowledge, social support and material wealth
* Anti social existence: Humans are said to be social but world is divided in countries with imagined borders. Family, communities and neighborhood are also breaking. Everyone is individualistically left to be on their own for survival and without appropriate emotional comfort and nurturing relationships.
* Lies, deciet, lack of trust and confidence in each other at every level
* Tension and stress
* Poor quality of food

## Mixed good and bad
* Scientific, technological and material development: More physical comfort to some (though not all)
* More power to humanity but being used by power instead of using power wisely

## The good of 21st century
* Ease of distant communication and greater access to information and stimulus
* Greater scientific and technical knowhow and capability

> Is there any real joy left in today's world, for most of us, in most of the moments, in most of the places, countries, communities or families?
