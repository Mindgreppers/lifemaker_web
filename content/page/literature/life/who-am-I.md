## Life: the conscious seer and experiencer of existence

> The real you and real me must be made of the same fabric from which entire existence is made - energy. Hence, we are but a-unit-of-energy which has become conscious of its presence in existence and is experiencing, learning and interacting with the existence consciously.

There are three kinds of truth sets that exist in this regard in humanity.

- A. I am eternal, indestructible & indivisible unit-of-energy which has become conscious of its presence in Existence and is on the journey of remembering what it is and all-that-is.
- B. I am the body or a byproduct (epiphenonmenon) of the body. My consciousness is a collective phenomenon of the trillions of unconscious cells that make my body, nervous system and brain.
- C. I don't know.

The belief in eternal nature of Self or Life (Truth set A) is a foundational stance of Lifemaker. There is a long standing philosophical debate on this since ages between spiritualists and materialists - whether a unit of Life is an epiphenomenon of body and ends with it, or is Life immortal?

###### So how to be sure whatever you know or think you know is really true? 

- Your truth set must be [useful to your existence in co-existence](/the-job-of-any-truth-set-is-to-be-useful) as explained in another chapter. In short, by being useful, your truthset should have a measurably positive and stable affect on you, your relationships and the world you live in. Not only the world around you but also your own heart will attest to the goodness you feel within and spread without on a day to day, hour to hour, minute to minute, second to second basis.
- Only the whole of the conscious you can know the whole of you, so your heart and your mind have to attest to the truth.

###### So what is the whole of you as a human?

No matter what is your belief system we can agree that broadly your existence as a human is of three parts.

- The body which is operated by the mind, through which mind percieves the world and also acts in the world. This is made of trillions of unconscious cells which constitute the nervous system, brain and rest of the body.
- The mind which desires, thinks, hopes, compares, analyses, evaluates, makes choices, tastes the outcomes and learns.
- The center (heart, soul) whose role is _experiencing_ everything including the mind. It is the screen which is blank in deep sleep and on which everything appears in dreaming or awake state. This part is the deepest part which not only experiences but is the very source of all your expression. Haven't you ever experienced "Singing from the heart or expressing from the heart"?

> Only together, the mind and soul can together and not alone, truly realise any part of reality. Haven't you ever experienced knowing something so surely that you don't even need to think about it. Your heart 'feels and knows'. Your mind tries to comprehend how what-you-know by heart makes sense. For example, knowing that your father is about to arrive in five minutes even though you can't explain how and why you know it? Sometimes a logical reasoning or intellectually sounding argument doesn't dawn upon immediately. But from the depths of your heart you know what-is and the deepest part of your mind feels fully committed to go by your heart's knowledge and belief. Haven't you ever experienced this? 

But of course in order for your knowledge to be full and absolute, the mind also needs to comprehend what you know because it is an inseparable part of your existence. Only the whole of your existence is needed to understand the whole of your existence. 

The trouble starts that most of humanity uses only half of their capability. They use only the superficial parts of their mind, never reaching the deepest part of the Self, to contemplate, understand and realise reality. Their approach is limited to thinking, comparison, analysis, visualisation. Contemplation and total comprehension by mind rarely happens. The heart is even less touched upon.

_In this chapter we will not try to convince anyone of reality. Our intention is to simply make you think on certain things._

But I would like to talk a little about the necessity and also the limit of intellectual argumentation. Because it is important to realise something about the mind, its limitation and usefulness. Philosophy and science serve a useful purpose by helping intellectualise and contemplate upon Self and Existence. But since mind is only a part of the Self, it can not realise the nature of the whole Self by itself. By the same virtue of being part of the whole Self, mind is also necessarily required for full realisation. **Only the whole can realise the nature of the whole** of which the mind is a part. Hence philosophy, science, maths and physics are tools are useful and as humans - necessary too, but they are not enough alone nor are they absolute as they are tools of the mind only. 

**There is something deeper than the mind - it is that part of the Self which is _'experiencing'_ everything - the body, the world, even the mind and itself. We can call it the soul or the heart or the center of Self.** Heart is the deepest part of the Self. The heart is the experiencer, the observer, the expressor. 

Till the heart has not realised the nature of existence and experienced the bliss of knowledge, everything is mere mental concept & information and not true knowledge. Till the soul is not fully realised Life does not experience peace, contentment and bliss, and does not exhibit consistency of 'moral' living, positivism and inspiration in continuity. It is not able to do what it feels is right. There is conflict both inside and in relationship with the world.

When realisation of nature of Self and existence as co-existence happens, it is felt by all the layers of the mind and right through to the heart. In that moment the whole of Self knows, that it knows. And there is bliss! The attestation by the heart is joined by full mental clarity and resolution. The knowing that is so sure and certain that there is no scope of any doubt left whatsoever. When the heart is realised as well the mind has full comprehension of the realisation, Life has achieved its full evolution. There is eternal happiness, peace, contentment and bliss because the mind is fully resolved for permanence and all unecessary desires, hopes and thoughts have come to an end for good. There is stability in thought, work and behavior. Full realisation is the end of all conflict and suffering. It is the beginning of an eternal status of pure blissful existence and co-existence. 

> Realisation is understanding is enlightenment is knowledge is bliss is peace is contentment.

### Coming back to: What am I? 

> I am an eternal, indestructible and indivisible spec of energy existing in [all-that-is](/existence-itself-is-coexistence). All-that-is is made of one fabric only - of infinite energy. All is one-&-only and I am a part of it.
I am a wave of energy swimming in the infinite sea of energy with other waves. All is one-&-only. I exist, intricately connected with a body to experience the sea and express itself as part of the sea. The substance that constitutes me is the same substance that constitutes every particle, wave or life in existence. The same substance that is manifesting as 'others' is manifesting as 'me'. The constituion and process is the same in all Life and on this Earth, it is most evolved in humans. The way consciousness experiences existence is same in every Life. All is the one infinite sea. I am an an inseparable part of it.  


Wait. Really?


Then there is the second kind who believe in the eternal, indestructible and indivisible nature of their Self. In my experience the ones who truly and really believe in immortality of the Self and live as that consistently demonstrate greater humane nature than the ones who believe they are the body or from the body. All the greatest humans ever known who served humanity selflessly believed themselves not to be the body. This has been consistently a central point of their teachings as well. If knowledge is wisdom and wisdom is humaneness then the knowledge Budhdha, Jesus and the likes of them carried surely made them the most humane people we have ever heard about. And even in my common experience in this lifetime, the ones who are truly sincerely spiritual are the most humane breed of humans I have met, judging by their selfless actions and behavior. I believe their truth is useful for them and co-existence. Yet, in existence, infinite Lives live with their [own perspective of reality](/7-billion-people.-7-billion-truth-sets) and they are all welcome. In the end, whichever is the seer's truth, [must be useful to them and the world.](/the-job-of-any-truth-set-is-to-be-useful)



Hang on..

For knowing Life's origin and nature we will have to observe and contemplate about the nature of energy. 

> Existence is not aimless. Every atom is self inspired and imbued with purpose. Every ounce of energy is undergoing through a unidirectional progression of development progress, development, evolution progress and evolution. 

#### 1. Development process

##### Energy that is not stably in equilibrium seeks stability of equilibrium.

> There are three kinds of activities of energy - making, breaking and balance (or stability).

_Please pay attention to this and contemplate for a while - The Space is energy in all-round equilibrium. Manifest energy is the energy which is not in equilibrium and is seeking the same. Manifest energy exists inseparably within the Space. Manifest energy is but the Nature itself and it is forever transient, **seeking stable equilibrium to be just like the silent Space within which it is contained**. Observe how energy flows from one form to another - from the rays of the sun to the food that you eat to the energy you expend in walking and that expended energy in walking converts to some other form of energy in an infinite flow. Once a unit of energy finds the stable equilibrium within - for example an atom, it stays compacted forever unless destroyed by external energy. **The atom likes to exist stably just like how it is**, even though it may move from here to there as part of a larger macro current (For example, atoms in the air or water). The pursuit to exist stably can be observed even in biological world as the innate drive of any species to adopt and strive for greater chances of survival._ 

This process of energy's pursual for stable forms and thereby engaging in compositions, temporary equilibriums and decompositions, can be called **development progress** wherein energy is seeking to develop into forms that stay stable (i.e. permanent). The tendency of energy (existence) to move towards and stay in stabile equilibrium is even recognised in science as second law of thermodynamics. We can also attest from our human experience that it is good to be in "balance". As humans we also prefer permanent solution to our needs over temporary ones. **Need for permanent balance (stability) is an innate drive of nature both material and conscious.** 

And what is development? Let's look next.

#### 2. Development 
##### Birth of Life itself is development of energy. 

A unit of energy finally developing into a permanently stable (eternally existing) form is development. 

> Energy keeps on constituting and spilliting from various forms seeking stability of equilibrium, to ultimately reach a form which is stable and where the form's destruction is not possible no matter how strong the external forces. That type of unit of energy is Life, is akin to a conscious atom. It is what you and I am. We are permanent, indestructible and indivisible unit of energy.

Energy indeed achieves permanence as-a-constitutional-form when a unit of Life is born. Becoming a conscious bundle (atom or whatever you would like to name it) is the end of aeons of development process where energy comes together as an indestructible unit (Life). All ancient spiritual wisdom and for any human, a personal spiritual insight comes with the same realisational knowledge. 

_**I am. I am eternal. I am not this body. I am with this body.**_

Here are some points to think about Life, about yourself, your origin.

- Birth of Life is an act of a certain bundle of energy towards eternal permanence of its existence as that unit.

- The conscious atom (Life) has a certain _form and internal arrangement_ which allows it to be conscious of its existence in the [co-existence](/existence-itself-is-coexistence). At the moment of birth of Life energy undergoes a change in its manifestation from inert physical energy which operates in the known fields to science like electromagnetic, gravitational, quantum fields etc., to conscious energy which operates on some transcendental fields yet to be discovered by science (or most probably never will). From being physical atoms or free flowing energy, energy shifts to being another kind of _atom or unit of energy_ with a unique constitution that exhibits self consciousness in the co-existence.

- Life is weightless as can be seen by weightlessness of thoughts, desires and hopes.

- Life enjoys freedom from physical forces like electromagnetism, gravity etc. It is pretty evident as desires and thoughts are not _governed_ by physical fields like gravity. We have power of control over our thoughts irrespective of the physical forces surrounding us. Even if my body has had lot of alcohol I percieve its effect but I always have _the potential_ to control how I think.
  
- Life is govered by the force of desire. Every desire is somewhere rooted in the pursuit of the deepest desire of _happiness, peace, contentment and bliss_ which is the same across every life. Even in animals but fully so in humans. 

- Life can consciously affect any part of the infinite existence. The extent of the effect is not limited or affected by distance. For example, affecting the thoughts of each other or listening to each other from thousands of kilometers apart. Inert atoms or big objects like Earth also affect entire existence through different fields like electromagnetic or gravitational fields, but the effect diminishes based on distance.

- Conscious energy can exert control over material energy. We are connected with a body (gross physical, subtle energetic, more subtle mental & most subtle causal) with which we do things and we percieve the world. Hence whatever Life is, it can connect with and affect matter and energy in physical fields through its body. Life is found to co-exist with the body. Upon contemplation it is revealed that Life can do nothing without a body. It always needs a body. So it must be so that Life (consciously or subconsciously) assembles a body instantaneously at its birth and thereafter, upon discarding bodies it doesn't need anymore. 


#### 3. Evolution progress
##### The gradual realisation of true nature of Self and Existence, finding wisdom and increasing freedom from desires and aversions is evolution progress.

- With formation of a unit of Life that part of infinite manifest energy ends its journey of aeons of material development. It becomes _developed_. It finds its constitutional completeness as a unit of matter. From there it starts on another journey, possibly spanning aeons again. That journey is of _evolution progress or growth_. That journey is about discovery of own Self and finding the equilibrium within.

#### 4. Evolution
##### Full and final awakening, in continuity & for eternity is evolution.


Once that happens, existence reaches the pinnacle of its development and evolution through that fully developed and evolved unit of energy. That itself is awakening, enlightenment or liberation.


In [Madhyasth Darshan](http://www.madyasth-darshan.info), Shri A Nagraj calls Life as a conscious atom and he explains about Life in great objective detail. Conscious atom, Life or I, is a mere choice of words. I suggest we pay attention to the object being meant by the word. That object is the phenomenon of which you, me and every other animal or conscious being out there in existence are instances or units of. A unit of that phenomenon is being called Life or conscious atom in Lifemaker literature.
