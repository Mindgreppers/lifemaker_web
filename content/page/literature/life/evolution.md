> Life - a conscious unit of energy like you, me and the one in ant form too - is headed on a journey of evolution. Life is like a river which is meant to fully realise its source, its destination, its Self and the oneness of all. Life is on a journey to realise how it is an inseparable part of all-that-is.


Since its inception this unit goes through a journey of evolution where its constituent parts find a greater alignment between them as "the river progresses". Ultimately there is a point when the river reaches the ocean - that ocean is of full evolution of consciousness. It is of Budhdhahood. It is of permanence of full , absolute and continuous resonance between the constituent parts of the seer. This is the state of all knowing where hopes, desires and unecessary thoughts come to a halt. This is the state of peace, contentment and bliss.

So indeed since its true birth, the seer evolves (in its journey of experience like a river), but is bound to ultimately reach the point where evolution is complete (river meets the "infinite" ocean). In the "ocean consciousness" there is resonance or in another words state of internal equilibrium and clarity. This resonance is full & brilliant resonance with the primordial, stable and infinite energy in equilibrium ([The Space](/void)), and also an interplay with the evolving nature (body, world). Full and final evoluted state does not make one like an inert atom. One still perceives through the body, thinks through the mind and acts in the world. Present in the here and now with fullness, one feels everything around it with a full mind. Yet it does not get 'swayed' by whats around for it has found its internal equilibrium, poise, stance, clarity, stability, harmony, peace or any other name of that state which is the pinnacle of evolution of the consciousness. That state of which Budhahood is another reference word. That state where the state of the self is akin to the [Void](/void).
