## Singularity - All is ONE. ONE is All.

Like gold exists as the self same in all jewels (forms) and even without jewels, but the jewels have no existence without the Gold, what exists as the unchanging same in *all that is*, and also where there is none of that, is the Source of everything. Because that Source is eternal, omnipresent and unchanging, free from desires and ever fulfilled, it's nature is happiness. The mind, ego, body and World have a lifespan, and are forever changing. They come from the same Source and go back into the same. Associating our nature to that of these transient objects, we get swayed away from happiness - our true nature. That Source is the center of the Self. It is the Self itself. Everything else is an expression of that real Self, like waves are to the ocean.

This revelation is not new. It is ageless. The same insight is passed by all relegions, sages, prophets and philosophers in different words suited for their times.

- [La ilaha illa-Allah](http://www.techofheart.co/2007/05/la-ilaha-illa-allah-and-advaita-supreme.html) (Quran, Prophet - "the formula that outweights all the existence and formulas combined") 
- [’Ehyeh ’ăšer ’ehyeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_that_I_Am) (Hebrew Bible, Exodus 3:14, God to Moses)
- [I AM THAT I AM](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+3%3A14&version=KJV) (Bible) 
- [Aham Brahmasmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aham_Brahmasmi) (Advaita Vedanta, the foundation of Hinduism)
- [The principle that is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists](/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) (Taosim)
- [Advaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism#Buddhism) (Buddhism)
- [Non-dualism across philosophers, relegions and spiritual movements across the world and history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism)

Read more about the philosophy of non-duality [here](/philosophy), or just search on internet yourself to see how every relegion and prohet spoke the same in different words.

#### Duality of co-existence 

From I, comes WE. Let us co-exist together for mutually fulfilled and justful living. 

The more we realise the primordial nature of our consciousness, as an experiential reality, the less we will be at odds with co-existence, because we will all be aligned at the source, the center, the dot, the omnipresent I. There will be peace, prosperity and happiness. Every Sage, Saint or Prophet lovingly wished to unify humanity on the same principal. We are taking their work forward.
