## We believe that

There is an infinite source of happiness and abundance in our Heart. It is omnipresent and unchanging. It is One, manifesting as many, each playing a unique role in the World created by the same One. We may have forgotten our true nature but deep down we all seek the same. Love, Happiness, Oneness, Truth, Knowledge, Abundance, Contentment, Nature, Singularity, Supreme Self â€“ all are different names or faces of the same.
