The family based approach consists of five main components.

- satsang - a mutually fulfilling environment providing nutrition, safety and love where every member feels trust and emotional wellbeing
- discussion - in Satsang, we mutually discuss how can wellbeing and safety be achieved in a jutsful way
- study - how to be and do, with happiness and not for happiness. How can this state of happiness change from being initially repetitive to ultimately continous. 
- contemplation - understanding of entire existence with all its objects including nature of individual self *in thoughts*
- meditation - being and experiencing the entire existence with all its objects including nature of individual self *in void or silence*
