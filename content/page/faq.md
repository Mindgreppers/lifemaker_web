#### What is the history of this movement?
This vision of establishment of Undivided Human Society with a social order ensuring overall wellbeing for all, has been dream of many over time. In India, there have been a number of people who have been understanding, talking about and working on the proposal since many years. 
The good news is that now we seem to have a universally acceptable perspective and solution proposal, thanks to work done by some in 20th and 21st century, especially the [Madhyastha Darshan movement](http://www.madhyasth-darshan.info). 

While the complete solution to all human problems is available to humankind now, the vision has is yet to manifest into reality as a social tradition and order. The good news is that a formal effort for setting up the Undivided Society with its [working model](/approach), has begun now. The pilot, in progress at village Saalig and neighoboring areas, in Dharamsala, H.P. India is aimed at establishing the first formal undivided society's village node on the ground. 

Along with this, there has also been a steady effort with academia for few years now. The education part of the program has been running in government schools, colleges & universities of India for a while now. The [Universal Human Values Education program](http://uhv.org.in/) introduced a self transformation course as a fist year compulsory activity at Universities in India and Bhutan is aimed at educating and transforming the youth of society. So far thousands of young students and teachers have undertaken this program and know what we are talking about on this website. The [Madhyastha Darshan movement](http://www.madhyasth-darshan.info) has been active for more than 3 decades now in imparting the proposal to inquisitive beings. Thousands of individuals and families from India have benefitted from the same and have started educational institutions and community spaces across the India for demonstrating the solution and spreading the education. [Viridus](http://www.viridus.in), same education program to youth in other colleges of India. They are calling the same movement as Global Wellbeing Movement. 

From 2015 to 2017 we tried to take an internet first approach where a mobile app would help everyone connect around this intention. We did [an android app pilot in 2016](https://github.com/mindgreppers/lifemaker), a [successful crowdfunding](https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/lifemaker) for final app design with graphics. But we soon realised that without a solid physical, practical plan on how to reorganise and live on the ground, and without a local and global team which understands things the same way and is aligned for the same goal, things would just be in the air and mobile app wouldn't achieve the goal without necessary grounding. The grounding we found was a [working model](/approach) on how to live as undivided human society, and the [values with which to live](/values). The discovery of [Madhyastha Darshan proposal](http://www.madhyasth-darshan.info) in 2018 and its community helped filled any gaps in the understanding and also find more people dedicated to the same cause. It took us a while to study and understand the fresh perspective in 2018 and 19 from various teachers @ the informal Madyasth Darshan group in India, and from other sources across the world.

In 2019, now armed with holistic understanding to human resolution, we kickstarted our first pilot of the working model in village Saalig, Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. Starting 2020, we plan to launch few services like online registration and incubation, study material & courses, discussions, mutual help network, local circular ecommerce, conscious travel network etc. on the Undivided Society run infrastructure.  Once Lifemaker pilot succeeds in integrating the people of few villages in H.P., India, and we also develop shared universal understanding with more people from across the world, the movement will be ripe to expand organically in 2020 - both on ground in various cities and villages, and globally through online collaboration. 

#### Who are the people working towards this?

This project is by Society and for society and all its work has to be done by Society. Currently people from pilot village Saalig have started to take interest in the movement. Along with them many teachers and social workers across India are working towards the same goal. We can not name all of them for the list is long. 

To get the Swarajya started on ground from villages, [Ayush Ghai](/ayush) is coordinating the on ground pilot in village Saalig, with help of rest of society. He, along with his IT company [Mindgrep](http://www.mindgrep.com) is providing its technical and financial I.P. and support, on volunteer basis. Along with Shivashankar from [Viridus](http://viridus.in) he is coordinating the setup of the tech infrastructure. We are also in process of assembling the first India and World councils, so that the program can run in autonomous mode, from pilot villages to world council. They are getting critical guidance and help from [Universal Human Values Education team](http://uhv.org.in/)
