## About

#### Who are the people involved in this project?
Primarily at the moment we are three couples and our friends and family support our vision. We are evolving a deeper understanding into self and everything together and we want to collaborate with our neighboring villagers and rest of humanity to bring forth the universal working model of Lifemaker as a timeless tradition across the world. Our team has a general track record of social service in some form or the other. Though we are computer engineers, massuese, chartered accountant, shop keeper, farmers by profession we are all same as humans and we wish to live in an equal society where everyone shares same understanding of life, existence and the way to be, and enjoys social respect, love and material abundance.

#### Can I join?
Everyone is welcome to join. Our online forum (to go live in 2018 second half) is open to *anyone and everyone* for mutual help and discussions. Our tribe welcomes people from any walk of life. To get involved deeper into Lifemaker, we will need to come to the same understanding hence it will be best that you attend one of our camps or stay with us for longer term with your family or friends.

#### How to get in touch?
You can join our low traffic [mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/lifemaker), follow us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/lifemaker-app), join our upcoming [forum](/forum) or come and meet us in person at our [community space](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5424351357#map=19/32.19787/76.36606) in the Himalayas or at one of our events (Check the calendar!) We keep making announcements on our social channels and mailing list about latest and greatest updates.

## The Charter
#### What is the Way of Living?
The Way of Living is the five point working model based on identified Universal values that apply to every human as part of the same reality in which we all co-exist.

#### How old is Lifemaker?
The name was given in 2015. Madyastha Darshan family, with whom we got connected recently, has a 50 year old history and has pockets in India where people are living in a way very close to what Lifemaker envisions.

#### What activities have we done in past?
Since last few years, few of us were independently thinking on "how to raise Human consciousness and live better in an alternative way". Then we met, and we kept meeting since then. The evolution is still going on as we gain members and perspectives. Our members have been collaborating remotely and meeting for few days to months at stretch. Till 2017 we had been based in a community space called [Infinity hackerspace](http://www.hackerspaces.org/wiki/infinity) in Dharamsala, HP, India. 
We have done [an android pilot](https://github.com/mindgreppers/lifemaker), a [successful crowdfunding](https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/lifemaker) for events, app design and graphics, [first official gathering](https://medium.com/lifemaker-blog/foundation-meetup-briefing-648002e226cd) in November 2019. We have been conducting events and also being travelling to share with other people.
