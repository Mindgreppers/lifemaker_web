#### Who are the main people behind this movement as of now?

There are many people across India and the world who are working towards the vision of establishing Undivided Human Society in happiness and prosperity. The universal solution has emerged in its broad skeleton, thanks to collective work by many humans. 

Currently Lifemaker initiative is being conducted by member families from the pilot village called Saalig in Dharamsala, H.P., India, and also some humans from India who have been understanding and sharing the universal understanding of Self, Human and Existence, and the working model for undivided human society, with universities, teachers, students and general population for few years now. They have also been living based on same principles and demonstrating the same to the world for inspiration. [Viridus](http://www.viridus.in), a partner team for the same cause, is calling the same movement as Global Wellbeing Movement.

While this project is by Society, to incubate it from the seed, [Ayush Ghai](/ayush) is coordinating the movement for now, till world council is formed. He is closely assisted by people from pilot village Saalig where he is the main facilitator for transforming the village into Undivided Human Society. He is also assisted by few teachers, philosophers and social workers who seek and share Universal Understanding and are committed to the same cause.

#### What is the history and current status of this initiative so far?

For first few years in 2015/16/17 we thought a lot about the problem, the solution and tried to take an internet first approach where a mobile app would help everyone connect around this intention. We did [an android app pilot in 2016](https://github.com/mindgreppers/lifemaker), a [successful crowdfunding](https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/lifemaker) for final app design with graphics. But we soon realised that without a solid physical, practical plan on how to reorganise and live on the ground, and without a local and global team which understands things the same way and is aligned for the same goal, things would just be in the air and mobile app wouldn't achieve the goal without necessary grounding. The grounding we found was a [working model](/approach) on how to live as undivided human society, and the [values with which to live](/values). The discovery of [Madhyastha Darshan proposal](http://www.madhyasth-darshan.info) in 2018 and meeting various people who have been enlightened by its simplistic explanations filled the gap in our understanding. It took us a while to study and understand the fresh perspective in 2018 and 19 from various teachers @ the informal Madyasth Darshan group in India.

In 2019, we kickstarted our first pilot of the working model in village Saalig, Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. So the tech infrastructure has been put in background till 2020 when we plan to launch few services like online registration, study material & courses, discussions, mutual help, ecommerce on the Undivided Society run infrastructure.  Once Lifemaker pilot succeeds in integrating the people of this village and we also develop shared universal understanding with more people from across the world, the movement will be ripe to expand organically in 2020 - both offline and online.
