## About

#### Who are the people involved in this project?
There are many people who’ve helped/inspired the LifeMaker project and have given an invaluable contribution to its inception. We are joined by a bunch of elders, volunteers and supporters in different roles. We are getting special help from [Saadho](http://saadhosangha.org) and [Enlightened Family Project](madhyasth-darshan.info) teams.

#### Can I join?
Everyone is welcome to join. Our tribe welcomes people from any walk of life. Just that we wish you join with your family or community, with whom you live on an intimate basis, so that we are more effective. 

#### How to get in touch?
You can join our low traffic [mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/lifemaker), follow us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/lifemaker-app), join our upcoming [forum](/forum) or come and meet us in person at our [community space](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5424351357#map=19/32.19787/76.36606) in the Himalayas or at one of our events (Check the calendar!) We keep making announcements on our social channels and mailing list about latest and greatest updates.

## The Community
#### Does LifeMaker have a physical space?
Our homes and hubs are your space. Our first hub is in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. We are distributed across India and Italy mostly, for now.

#### How do we gain members? 
It will mostly mean a visit to one of our families or attending our workshops and retreats. Once we arrive at a common understanding, a mutual call happens.

#### How do I visit/join the community?
You are welcome to come and stay with us. Reach out to us through contact information on home page and we’ll help you sort out the travel arrangements. 

#### Is there a primary hub to get introduced to Lifemaker community and way of Life?
The ground Zero for Lifemaker is in the lap of Himalayas at Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. 

#### How do I participate in LifeMaker events?
You can check out our event calendar and see if there’s an event happening near your home. Otherwise, you might ask us to add a date. 

#### Are the events free?
The cost of our events, like all of Lifemaker activities, are covered by contribution through members. If someone has a financial limitation, they can approach us and request a free or subsidised entry, in return for volunteer work for the event.

#### How do I connect my family with LifeMaker?

## The Charter
#### What is the Way of Living?
The Way of Living is an aspirational charter of Universal values, which all LifeMaker subscribe to and is aimed to bring the best out of everyone, for everyone’s benefit.

#### Do I have to agree with the Way of Living?
The Way of Living is an aspirational charter and must not be taken as a compulsion, because in compulsion there is no Freedom - which is one of our aspirations. It is intended as a set of shared guidelines to keep as an ethical compass in our lives.

#### How can I follow the Way of Living in my life?
The intention will already make wonders. We all need to work on ourselves, in a family based approach, and put in the daily effort to become the best we can possibly be. We have a family based education approach.
We all have some flaws. We all make mistakes and that’s when you’ll find in the LifeMaker community, all the support and guidance you’ll need to get back on track.

#### How can I contribute to the Way of Living?
The Way of Living is an open document and will evolve as our community evolves.  You can contribute by contacting us with your suggestions and inputs.

## History
#### How old is Lifemaker?
The name was given in 2015. It is best to consider Lifemaker as never born. The team started gaining strength since last two years.

#### What activities have we done in past?
Since last few years, few of us were independently thinking on "how to raise Human consciousness and live better in an alternative way". Then we met, and we kept meeting since then. The evolution is still going on as we gain members and perspectives. Our members have been collaborating remotely and meeting for few days to months at stretch. Mostly we have been based in a community space called [Infinity hackerspace](http://www.hackerspaces.org/wiki/infinity) in Dharamsala, HP, India. 
We have done an android pilot, a i[successful crowdfunding](https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/lifemaker) for events, app design and graphics, [first official gathering](https://medium.com/lifemaker-blog/foundation-meetup-briefing-648002e226cd) in November 2019. We have been conducting events and also being travelling to share with other people. 
Initially we were focussing on an online heavy strategy. But we realised we need a ground based strategy, where the understanding of Life and way of Living is demonstrated by few families, for the world to learn from and collaborate physically. Our pilot is being planned near Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh. We will be starting by sharing the understanding and model, through 7 day workshops, in summer 2018. With the base operations started in the pilot, we will be doing workshops across India and world in coming time. 

#### Is Lifemaker registered as a not-for-profit organisation yet?
Not yet. It will be done when needed. Till then we are managing as a loosely connected group of people, and gaining core team of people and families committed full time to this project.
