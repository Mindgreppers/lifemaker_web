#### Who are the main people behind Lifemaker and what is the history?

There are many people across India and the world who are working towards the vision of establishing Undivided Human Society in happiness and prosperity. The universal solution has emerged in its broad skeleton, thanks to collective work by many humans. 

Currently Lifemaker initiative is being conducted by member families from the pilot village called Saalig in Dharamsala, H.P., India, and also some humans from India who have been understanding and sharing the universal understanding of Self, Human and Existence, and the working model for undivided human society, with universities, teachers, students and general population for few years now. They have also been living based on same principles and demonstrating the same to the world for inspiration.

As it happens, the coordinator of the work @ Lifemaker front is [Ayush Ghai](/ayush) for now. He is closely assisted by people from pilot village Saalig where he is the main facilitator for transforming the village into Undivided Human Society. He is also assisted by few teachers, philosophers and social workers who seek and share Universal Understanding and are committed to the same cause.

For first couple of years we tried to take an internet first approach where a mobile app would help everyone connect around this intention. We did [an android app pilot in 2016](https://github.com/mindgreppers/lifemaker), a [successful crowdfunding](https://www.ketto.org/fundraiser/lifemaker) for final app design with graphics. But we soon realised that without a solid physical, practical plan on how to reorganise and live on the ground, and without a local and global team which understands things the same way and is aligned for the same goal, things would just be in the air and mobile app wouldn't achieve the goal without necessary grounding. The grounding we found was a [working model](/approach) on how to live as undivided human society, and the [values with which to live](/values). So the tech infrastructure has been put in background till 2020. We are doing our first pilot of the working model in the Himalayan slopes of Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh. Once Lifemaker pilot succeeds in integrating the people of this region, the movement will be ripe to expand online organically in parallel.
