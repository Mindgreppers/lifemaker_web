Finally, thanks to collective work by many thinkers, researchers and realized humans, we have proposals for universal human resolution that should be able to solve for permanence, all human problems and needs - within each individual, family, village, area, nation, global human society and with rest of Nature - for as long as humans live on Earth. The education arm of the [social working model](/working-model) will present the same proposals to the society and help people internalize and experience the knowledge, in methods custom designed for families, teachers, children and youth.

> Unlike most of previous human approaches based on _faith before knowledge_, these proposals encourage to assume (have faith in) only what is known and understood by oneself as reality. Instead of prescribing a list of do's & don'ts, these proposals simply appeal to common human's mind for developing greater understanding and thereby live resolved for good.

The proposals facilitate discussion on life goals, reflection on what you are and what you really want to be, on relationships in family, society and with nature/existence. It follows a process of self verification, on the basis of one's own Natural Acceptance, leading to self-empowerment and personal transformation. It can provide the base and details for the sustained well-being of all, i.e. societal transformation and harmony with Nature. 

> The proposals encompass explanation of Self as Human and Existence as Co-existence, human needs, human value system and the personal and social outlook & solution towards human & environmental needs & problems. Along with this we are in process of releasing the manifesto of undivided society, constitution, policies, systems, infrastructure for public evaluation. 

### The basic premise of the proposals

> Every human's deepest aspiration is to live with a feeling of harmony, happiness and fulfillment in continuity, in self and in all relationships. 

For living in harmony as human being, family and society, the following four has been found to be a must have in each individual

* Proper understanding and experience of Self as Human and Existence as Co-existence 
* Relationships: right feelings, mutual fulfillment, justful work & behavior (in continuity)
* Healthy body and lifestyle 
* Abundance of physical facility (Feeling of mutual prosperity, _with rest of society and nature_)

Humankind's need is a social culture, environment and tradition that fosters a rise of human consciousness in everyone born with human form, in a way naturally acceptable to every human being. These proposals are about this only.
