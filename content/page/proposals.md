Finally, we have a proposal for universal human resolution that promises to solve for permanence, all human problems and needs - within each individual, family, village, area, nation, global human society and with rest of Nature - for as long as humans live on Earth. The education arm of the [social working model](/working-model) will present the same proposals to the society and help people internalize and experience the knowledge, in methods custom designed for families, teachers, children and youth.

Unlike most of previous human approaches based on _faith before knowledge_, these proposals encourage to assume (have faith in) only what is known and understood by oneself as reality. Instead of prescribing a list of do's & don'ts, these proposals simply appeal to common human's mind for developing greater understanding and thereby live resolved for good.

Every human's deepest aspiration is to live with a feeling of harmony, happiness and fulfillment in continuity. For experiencing harmony as human being, family and society, the following three is a must have in each individual

* understanding and experience of Self as Human and Existence as Co-existence, 
* justful work, behavior and right feelings in relationships 
* shared prosperity with rest of human family and nature.

Humankind's need is a social culture, environment and tradition that fosters the same, in a way naturally acceptable to every human being. These proposals are about this only.
