#### Documentary: Schooling the world: The white man's last burden
While animals behave by their breed. A human behaves by his education and Samskaras (conditioning). The education we have recieved reflects as the state of society we have today. Breaking families, breaking villages, cutting from nature, exploitation of nature and each other, wars, competition instead of cooperation, poor physical and mental health, fear based psyche, indulgence in luxury and excessive consumption etc. What is the cause of all of this? What has happened is that what we call "modern education" is basically literacy, general information and living skills, which comes along with some wrong notions about self, society and world... It does not include the core of the knowledge required by every human being: What am I as human? What is Existence? How does this world work? What is the way to live beautifully? What is my deepest aspiration as human? How can I and my family achieve that?

#### Call to the tribe: An intro to the concept made in 2017 [English]
Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when we are in sync with own true nature, and it reflects in fulfilment of our relationships with the world and with our own Self. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, our company of Truth can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of realised co-existential bliss; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way and for all our future generations to come on Earth.
