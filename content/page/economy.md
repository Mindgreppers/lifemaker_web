Lifemaker is a by people and for people project. Hence the ideas, funds, infrastructure and every resource is to be pooled by the members only. 
We intend to create a blockchain based economic system for internal use. Our prime goal is to ensure financial abundance for all members, and especially those, who make the world happier and better in meaningful ways

Hence we wish to keep

- Universal basic income for every member for 100 years
- Systemic incentives for "good actions" as recognised by the network. These good actions may change over time. For example, funding Lifemaker, teaching children, healing people or animals, cleaning the environment, waste recycling or giving land or property for community use.
- An upper limit on everyone's capital gains which should be reasonably high to ensure motivation, but not too high to ensure wealth does not get polarised in few hands and keeps circulating.
- A transparent and public accounting
