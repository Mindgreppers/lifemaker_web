We intend to create a blockchain based economic system for internal use. Our prime goal is to ensure financial abundance for all members across the world, and especially those, who make the world (plants, animals and humans) smile in any way

Hence we wish to keep

- Universal basic income for every member
- Systemic incentives for "good actions" as recognised by the network. For example, funding Lifemaker, teaching children, healing people or animals, cleaning the environment, waste recycling or giving land or property for community use.
- An upper limit on everyone's capital gains beyond a certain limit which should be reasonably high to ensure motivation, but not too high to ensure wealth does not get skewed in few hands.
- A transparent and public accounting
