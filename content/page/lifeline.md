## Our team

All of our member families are personally known and vetted before being included as Lifemakers. We’ll make sure to get you connected with the best possible fit for your need - maybe a family which lives close to you, or an expert from far who can speak remotely.  

Since this is a community based initiative, and still in growing stage, allow us some time to respond. You will surely hear back from us.

*Check out our [workshop and retreat calendar](/workshops-and-retreats). Its best to meet to dive deeper.*

* **We are happy to be useful in any way**, not just limited to the areas mentioned above, or just with advice. Our community has diverse abilities and interests. So ask us anything!*
