[Ayush Ghai](https://www.facebook.com/ayush.ghai), a philosopher, meditator, computer engineer from IIT Kanpur by training, software developer/architect and entrepreneur, a "human" human, is currently coordinating the work of this project. He is also the director and main stakeholder of [Mindgrep Technologies](http://www.mindgrep.com) which is like a for social cause IT company. Setting aside a promising career in the corporate world, [Ayush moved Mindgreo to Dharamsala in 2012](https://yourstory.com/2012/10/ayush-ghai-is-building-a-tech-startup-from-the-hills-of-dharamshala-mindgrep/) in order to satisfy his thirst for knowledge of Self & Existence and find eternal peace within. Till 2017 he had been based in a coliving and coworking community space that he along with his team managed. It was called [Infinity hackerspace](http://www.hackerspaces.org/wiki/infinity). Ayush was a co-founder of the space and the main person incharge. He also helped co-found and conduct [Hillhacks](/http://www.hillhacks.in), [Code camp 2016](https://github.com/Mindgreppers/HimachalCodeCamp2016/wiki) and other such community events about knowledge sharing, technology and teaching. Ayush has also been the main developer, architect and visionary behind [Metataste](http://www.metataste.com) - a free personalised movie recommendation service and [Elasticgraph](https://www.mindgrep.com/products/elasticgraph), a relational datastore, search and analytics engine cum digital asset management tool originally built for digitally preserving and presenting the teachings of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. Ayush currently facilitates the universal experience, understanding and exposure in young children and adults in the pilot village Saalig, which is also his current residence. He loves to meet others on the same journey, share experience, understanding and perspective, and collaborate in meaningful ways.

As he went on his journey of Yoga (union) he had experiences where it was blissfully revealed to him how everything was One, he wondered how beautiful the world would be in comparison to today, if everyone including all children could realise the oneness of all that is, live that way and feel the same joy and universal love that he was feeling in that moment. Such transcendental experiences and love for all, inspired him to look for answers on how this could happen for humanity as a universal tradition on Earth. 

On the way he was joined by a handful of more people who dream the same vision as him. He also met a bunch of people who had already answered some of these questions in great details at [Madhyastha Darshan](http://www.madhyasth-darshan.info) family.
