## Undivided Humanity. Thriving family. Holistic order. 
### Continuity of happiness
Happiness is what we truly seek behind all our endeavors. It is right between us, but disconnected from our Nature, we look for it elsewhere - obviously in futility. Today, we as individuals, families, states, race (and Earth in totality) are neither healthy nor happy. Even food and survival is becoming a bigger challenge with every passing day. The environment is becoming poisonous for both the body and the mind. When we are so disconnected from our own reality, how can we be in continuity of happiness? 

#### At Lifemaker, we wish to connect families and Humanity for Good

> by the way of Understanding the nature of Existence and Co-existence, and seeing the proof of this understanding or wisdom, in our daily Living. 

#### We believe family is the way to go 
because family is the fundamental unit of society, and is also the first place for comfort, security and love. Those of us who feel this way, are evolving and implementing a *holistic, family based understanding & approach to Existence and Co-existence, in an open frame*. 

### The aim is to raise consciousness 
to the levels where happiness is an everlasting tradition for every family, in co-existence on Earth. We aim to collectively establish a globally replicable blueprint that solves all the personal, familial, social and environmental issues humanity is facing today.

# Our approach

Our family understands and lives by [a Universal Value System](/values). Our member families live by fulfilling each other in every meaningful way possible. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living that way. Have a look at [the proposed blueprint](/post/approach).
