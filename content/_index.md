## The time has come for human achievement to unfold to its full potential

> Undivided human society living together and with rest of Nature as One World Family, in a self sustaining traditional environment that nurtures self realization, all round wellbeing, freedom, harmony, fulfillment and happiness, in the individual and relationships. To unite and live in celebration of Existence, with the right feeling, right understanding and shared prosperity at all levels of our inter-being - individual, family, village, area, region, nation state, Undivided Human Society, the World Family (every unit of Nature included).

The time is ripe for collective transition of Humanity towards pinnacle of its conscious evolution - establishment of undivided "human" society in Swarajya (Self Governance) with a universally & naturally acceptable understanding of Self as Human and Existence as Co-existence, human needs, human value system and the personal and social outlook & solution towards human & environmental needs & problems. Along with this we need the manifesto of undivided society, constitution, policies, systems, infrastructure, and most importantly we need member individuals, families to understand the concept and program and thereby join, collaborate, help others understand, reform the Self, family, village, neighborhood, region, state & collaborate in different areas of work from all across the world. 

> Here we are not talking of any sect or religion. Undivided human society unconditionally includes and loves every human as part of it, because only then is it undivided. And reality is that we are indeed undivided by nature, but only divided by our imaginary boundaries and conflicts. 

_Every human's deepest inspiration is to live with a feeling of harmony, happiness and fulfillment in continuity. Humankind's need is a social culture, environment and tradition that fosters the same, in a systematic and orderly way, naturally acceptable and consensually agreed upon by every human being._

This is an of Human Society, by Human Society and for _Human Society and the World_ movement, not to be ever owned by any individual or organization, but only by Free, Self Governing, "Undivided" "Human" Society. Lifemaker is just a good name to describe the feeling and purpose of what this movement is about. There can be more names as well, but the object is this movement itself.

## The universal human problem


> Our society and most of its individuals and families are not living freely, fearlessly, happily, harmoniously or mutually fulfilled, at least not all the time, if not most of the time. 

We are suffering from never ending strife, misunderstanding, miscommunication, division, conflict and misery at all scopes of human existence - within Self, families, neighborhoods, regions, humankind and with rest of Nature. 

Till date humankind has not been able to establish a self sustaining, familial and social order and environment, such that it fosters continuity of true liberation, happiness and fulfillment within each individual, family and all its relationships - from physical family, to village, to neighborhood, region, state, to the World Family.


## The universal human need

> Every human wants to feel fulfillment, happiness, peace, harmony _within its Self and with rest of the World, all the time_. _No matter what_ the belief is, situation is, expectation is or decision is, every human is ultimately seeking the same in every "here and now".

## The opportunity, the challenge, the solution

* To unite and live harmoniously, compassionately and prosperously as ONE World Family, as per the natural laws of Existence and the way we are actually, as human beings.
* To collectively and consensually establish, upkeep and live by a timeless tradition of self governance (Swarajya) from family, to village, to state to world family, based on Universal knowledge of Self and Existence, & freedom to live as our _real Self_, without conflicts or borders, with unshakeable acceptance, trust, empathy, respect, appreciation, wisdom, responsibility, affection, love and such human values, as undivided human society. 
* To understand, realize & live by universal resolution and familial & social working model which is naturally acceptable to every human alike, is _guaranteed to satisfy_ all human needs & aspirations (from material to consciuous, individual to physical family to neighborhood to world family, human to nature) and helps humanity realise and demonstrate the full potential of being human - the sole species of Knowledge Order on Earth (The other three orders being material, living and animal orders, which are perfectly evolved within themselves and living in mutual harmony).
* To establish and maintain family and grassroots based tradition of happy, prosperous, peaceful and harmonious self governance, covering broadly the aspects of human values development education (or Life education) and research, health and nutrition, ecology friendly production and services, local circular exchange and economy, justice (everyone's fulfillment) and celebration, nurture of nature and conservation & right utilization of resources, from family, to village, to village cluster, to area, to state, to global society level.   
* To establish and sustain justful and resolved family as the unit of undivided society. To ensure each human family lives with resolution for their material and conscious needs and responsibilities, lives happily and prosperously, in harmony with rest of human family & nature.

## The approach and work in progress
In order to align together our only refuge is to understand universal reality and come together with that perspective to live together as "humans". For this we need a parallel program for educational and societal reform. Here are the key points of the current proposed approach. 


* Put forward the first draft of vision, values, manifesto, policies and constitution for the undivided human society. This shall forever stay open to evolution as per increased universal understanding and consensus. The first version is expected to be put online, and applied in pilot villages, in 2020.

** The working draft of the aims and objectives, as written in 2018, can be found [here](/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tt9Tcn0pMVg1Q-GfvFX9ll8xko-5SuCoumR2UJG-LAw)

** The working draft of charter of values, drafted in November 2017, can be found [here](/values).

* Pick up few inspired families in pilot villages. Establish and prove the model through them. Setup the foundation nurseries of Undivided Human Society on ground. (First pilot village is Saalig, located in Tehsil Dharamsala, Dist. Kangra, India)
* Incubate and establish councils from the pilot villages to the world level. Collaborate between these teams to ensure success of local pilots.
* Develop and set up online infrastructure to help in relevant aspects of the social program for Self Governance. For ex. register as member individual, family, group etc., to study and understand from online content, discuss, network, collaborate, help, get help, exchange or sell products and services (locally first), travel across member spaces and families for experience & life education etc.

## What is family
Since family is the fundamental unit of of human society and the first and primary space for love, nurture, education and wellbeing, our approach is family based.

> A family doesn't have to be necessary blood related or headed by a married couple of different sex. As long as a family lives justfully within itself, with society and nature, the form of family and parenthood can be as varied as nature. Such a family, of any composition and relational combination as mutually constituted by its consenting members will be acceptable to undivided society (world family).

A family is a group of people living together with strong bond of love and trust, feeling assured of care, protection & nurture, expect happiness, peace, contentment & bliss with each other, share common vision, projects and intention for lifetime (like living happily together, raising children, making a home etc.) and are resolved and committed to make it happen responsibly.

> The building brick of undivided human society is a family committed to living justfully. be a committed to justful (mutually fulfilling) existence between itself and with the rest of society and world.

## The structure and decision making of undivided human society

> All decisions shall be done with consensus from bottom up through fractal self governing setup.

A family is a group of upto around 10 people, and will choose one member to represent it in the family group in which upto around 10 families will participate. The groups at village level will send one representative up to the village group level. The village groups will each send one representative to the district level, so and so forth till the world society level where in the end around 10 most wise people will boil up from grassroots to top, _all through consensus based decision making_.

If ever at any level, a group is not able to arrive at consensus on any issue, the represenatative's decision shall be consensually accepted by the members. A group will only be divided in wrong, and united in right. Whenever there is something wrong, the representative will break the tie, after listening to all the members of their group. Since the representative is personally member of the group and is chosen by the group of around 10 with consensus, they will have also put trust in the wisdom of the person chosen. This way everything that the society does will have agreement of every individual and group of the society from bottom up.

> Society will self govern itself based on wisdom, and power will serve wisdom.

### Traditional governance structures are yet to deliver total success

Traditional governance structures like kingship, religion, autocracy, communism, socialism and even democracy have failed to deliver on the promise of happiness and prosperity for the common human family, as a social order. Even democratically run countries are full of division, mismanagement, poor decision making, unpredictability and strife.

Why? Because democracy also runs by power and not wisdom. Those who get most votes come to power. The design of democracy by default divides the society into factions and parties. What we need and want is Undivided Human Society. 

> Another issue faced historically with all governance models is that the decisions for local people are made by few people sitting thousands of kilometers away from the local problem and needs. The solution is to provide power to local people, over local resources, in subservience to universal wisdom based responsible and consensual decisions. 

## The six dimensions of the social working model (how to be)
The working model covers six proposed dimensions for self-governed and self-sustainable families organised as grassroots based cooperatives and self help groups to co-exist in Universal orderliness across villages, neighborhoods, provinces, nations and united-humane-nation. These five dimensions broadly cover every aspect from human to nature, but can be expanded into a larger list by breaking individual dimensions. This is a proposal at this stage, and is kept adaptable to change.

* **Education and research** - [Family education](/literature/family-education) and research, covering value based consciousness development (the foundation) and skills/knowledge useful for living so that every family arrives and lives at _full human_ level, serves the co-existence in meaningful ways and is self reliant to produce goods and services and generate more resources than its needs for itself. 
* **Health** - Healthy lifestyle, natural healing practices, affordable medicine and cure in every neighborhood so that every family and village is self empowered to live healthy in body & mind. Also global research, cooperation and hospitals for providing medicine and cure beyond the local scope.
* **Eco-production, work and services** - Self-reliant families & neighborhoods producing in abundance through organic farming, cottage industry and with least dependency on heavy machinery or factories. Universal values and local resources based production, work and services in balance and symbiosis with nature and society. 
* **Justful exchange and local circular economy** - Giving and justice based (instead of self interest & maximisation of profit based) exchange where every family sustains as a giver and reciever of abundance. Co-ownership and co-management of resources, food storage, banking, barter & exchange markets as self help groups and cooperative societies organised from village (local) to united-humane-nation (global) levels, to ensure fulfillment every family's living needs as locally as possible along with necessary global cooperation and collaboration. To work on localised finite resource based localised economy instead of infinite resource based global consumeristic economy based on profit, hoarding, interest & inflation.
* **Justice and celebration** - By justice we mean not punishment or externally forced decision making, but mutual understanding and consensus based decisions and actions that ensure all round fulfillment of all parties involved. This culture of self discipline for justice will start from the physical family itself, and spread to the village family. From there to the World Society, to ensure justice at each level of social existence without any arguments, battles, fights or wars. To develop universal human values based manifesto, constitution, policies and laws for decentralised self-governance, collaboration and _consensual decision making_, and thereby self govern as undivided human society organised from village to united-humane-nation levels. To evolve and upkeep mechanisms which ensure justful, truthful and humane social environment within participating families and to strive for the same for all humanity. To have social celebration, festivals, fairs, events, songs, theater, arts and such to celebrate harmonious co-existence.
* **Nurture of nature and compassion with animals** - To ensure that rest of the Nature on Earth (and even beyond) is well taken care of, is enriched and thriving with human care and affection. To be compassionate with other life forms and ensure that animals and natural balance don't suffer because of human's misguided actions.

### Coming together with a shared, universal perspective is our only refuge

*We may have different viewpoints on nature of Self and reality, different skin color, occupations and opinions, but as humans we are all the same. Through honest objective and subjective inquiry humanity as society and each human is bound to understand and realise Truth in the same way, because we exist in the same Truth. Our sameness as humans, the onlyness of Truth (Existence in which we co-exist), honest self inquiry for Truth, and agreement on the way to live, is the (only) unifying ground, which will provide Life the absolute and permanent resolution it needs and seeks.* 

## Call to the tribe

> Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when we are in sync with own true nature, and it reflects in fulfilment of our relationships with the world and with our own Self. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, our company of Truth can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of realised co-existential bliss; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way and for all our future generations to come on Earth.
