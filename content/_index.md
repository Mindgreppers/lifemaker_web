### Human network dedicated to understanding Life and living in conscious co-existence with each other and Nature; via mutual help and complimentary cooperation.

> Have a look at [the proposed approach](/post/approach)

We welcome curious families and individuals from any background to spend time with us in India to understand Life, Existence and Co-existence; and join our network from their homes, farms and community spaces. 

We are also hosting an online social network for distance sharing and cooperation. It is being called [the Ashram](http://www.ashram.lifemaker.us) and will be up soon. This forum is open to everyone, and is a place for mutual help, life advice, evolution of Lifemaker and discussions on body and consciousness, Human and Humanity, Existence and Co-existence, family education, Universal Values and more such topics.  

Our on ground pilot is based in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. We are conducting workshops with local families to develop a shared understanding and starting to bond and live together with mutual cooperation. 

We are documenting the [Universal Values](/values) to live by, and also the working, conceptual and operational models for Humanity. 

*We are looking at evolving and implementing a complete solution to all Human needs - from matter to consciousness. This movement is a fresh start. While the founders and their network have a top level understanding and proposal, the movement needs the curiosity and involvement from the larger humanity to manifest and grow.*

## We are thankful 
to all relegions, messengers, philosophers, teachers, scientists, social reformers and all benevolent beings, for their contribution towards human evolution and upliftment. We wish to see their work to completion. We want to see Humanity reach its full potential. 

## Call to the tribe

Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when in sync with own true nature. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
