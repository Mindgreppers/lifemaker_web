## All is ONE

A Lifemaker's experiential reality (possibly starting as a belief) is that all Life and objects (body, mind, world etc) come from and go back to the same source. In fact they are no different from the (infinite) Source, or the (real) Self. Hence a lifemaker says 

> I am that (indivisible ONE). Any separation (between this body, world and Collective Consciousness or GOD) is an illusion. Everyone and everything that there is, is just Me. I extend love to all Life, which is but my real Self.

Realising this, the Lifemaker keeps dropping any attachments or obsessions with the limited ego-self, and lives freely and fearlessly as the Supreme Self evermore. It finds the source of eternal bliss, and from there and *as that*, it loves everything and everyone infinitely and unconditionally. A Lifemaker is a true source of bliss.

## We believe that

There is an infinite source of happiness and abundance in our Heart. It is omnipresent and unchanging. It is One, manifesting as many, each playing a unique role in the World created by the same One. We may have forgotten our true nature but deep down we all seek the same. Love, Happiness, Oneness, Truth, Knowledge, Abundance, Contentment, Nature, Singularity, Supreme Self – all are different names or faces of the same.

## We aspire to live in a certain way

> Please take time to review our [charter of the Way of Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0).

It is a shared aspiration of an attitude deemed fit for living a fulfilled and harmonious life – individually and socially. The charter is maintained by the Lifemaker community, forever evolving and improving. If you are considering joining us, please make an effort to review the charter. Let us know how it resonates with you, how can it be improved etc.
