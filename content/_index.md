### Lifemaker is the family of Universal love, Singular consciousness and Shared abundance. 

A Lifemaker will agree that the real Self, which is to be found, in the Heart, is also to be found, equally, in every animate or inanimate object, in entire universe. The calling of a Lifemaker, is to realise *that* as its real Self and keep making Life (happier) all around. With a highly dense and intense awareness, unlimited compassion and sense of Oneness, a Lifemaker supports and empowers life, to heal and improve itself. Lifemaker is an inclusive being, who treats everyone with same attention, affection and humility, being attached to no one at all or to everyone and everything equally. 

>> In a time where individualism trumps Oneness, we are here to spread Singular consciousness, Shared abundance and Undifferentiated love.

Our community has people with different skills and life experience, with a BIG heart. What is common between all of us is a deep understanding of "Who I am" and "How to live life best!". This understanding tells us that to make the most out of life, we must keep learning about our deepest nature, seek company of likeminded on same path, and serve the world with same or greater interest as one would have for one's ego-self. 

*With this intention we are here to make make our lives better, together!*

#### Why Lifemaker?

> We envision happiness, love and light for everyone!

We envision, in next few years, a paradign shift in human consciousnessness where there is ultimate peace, happiness and abundance in our lives - both within and between each other. We envision a day where no one goes hungry because we have enough to share. We envision so much peace, understanding and shared abundance that there be no need for any war or border control.

We envision significant chunk of, if not all, humanity to start following a [rightful and harmonious way of living](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0), and being *Enlightened enough*, to be content, happy and peaceful within and without, no matter what situation surrounds them. Having no worries or fears about their present or future, we want every Lifemaker to be free, blissful and selflessly creative in the present.
