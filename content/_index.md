## Are you truly happy and fulfilled?

*Are you feeling that life (or something to do with you) is not perfect? Are you facing some challenge or question that seem to puzzle you? Do you find yourself wishing for peace of Mind at times? Do you feel separate(or anguished) from the World? Do you feel you (or your life, World) need to improve? Are there any goals (or desires) you wish to realise? Do you derive joy in serving others, and wonder how you can serve better? Are you looking to expand your perspective and grow? Do you need help of any kind?* 

> Reaching out to us may be the best thing you do

No matter what is your area of concern, we may be able to channelise help for you. All it takes to get started is a message from you. Read more about the Lifeline feature [here](/lifeline)

*Just like an empty pot can not fill another cup, in order to truly make anyone happy and benefitted, you need to be happy and fulfilled yourself.*

## All is ONE. ONE is All.
> I am that (indivisible, unborn, undying, formless, eternal Self). 

I am the dot which is the center and the source of the circle on which exist objects like mind, ego-self, body and World. They are same as Me, the Self. Yet, the Self is different from them in the way that it can exist without them, but they can not exist without the Self. Just like gold (the formless) exists without the jewels (forms) made out of it; I exist, without this body, mind and world, which are just like jewels made out of gold, which is the real Me.

## We aspire to live in a certain way

> Please take time to review our [charter of the Way of Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0).

It is a shared aspiration of an attitude deemed fit for living a fulfilled and harmonious life – individually and socially. The charter is maintained by the Lifemaker community, forever evolving and improving. If you are considering joining us, please make an effort to review the charter. Let us know how it resonates with you, how can it be improved etc.

## Elders

Elders carry wisdom from their experience and life insights. Lifemaker has the blessing to have some truly Wise – Realised and Selfless souls, with loads of experience and enlightenment to share, and to guide and advice us as senior family members. Some of our current elders are – Ranganathan Chari from Kodaikanal, Anish Joel from Dharamsala, Pran Krsna Baba, Nimay Baba and others from Radhakund and Vrindavana, Swamiji Harish Karun from Tang, Dharamsala etc. More are on the way.
