## Am I truly happy and fulfilled? 
Is happiness my spontaneous nature? If not, is it my desire? If yes, then why am I not happy all the time? Do I do actions as a being of happiness or do I do actions, in order to be happy? Is it really helping? *Who am I*, really, (the One who is here right now)? Is there a purpose or grander scheme of things in being here and experiencing *all this*, in this form? Is there even a need to know the grander scheme? Or is it simply enough, to be My spontaneous, natural and happy Self? Is the happiness of My family, community, humanity, Co-existence not My happiness? **How can We be happy together?** Should something change, or *improve*? If yes, then what is it? Is it within, without or both? Do I, as in this human form, with this family and community, and do We, as humanity, have the possibility, of a complete, mutually fulfilling, and justful approach, towards ensuring nutrition, health, safety, love, abundance, happiness, meaningful growth and Self-realisation for all families like mine? Can we live in symbiosis with Nature, as equals with all animal and plant species? Are there others asking these same questions? Are there some who have answers? Are there some who are committed to, and or indeed *actually*, living this way? 

*Are you facing questions or challenges - material to mind to spiritual, or from personal to family to social? Do you need any kind of help or insight? Or do you wish to share an insight?*

## Philosophy: Who am I?

> **I am** (Existence, indivisible, integral, unborn, undying, formless, limitless, timeless, eternal Self, forever same, omnipresent, transcendental). **I am (Existence), with everyone (Co-existence).** 

Every one, has the same nature of Self within, because it is our True nature. This revelation is equally accessible to everyone, and we experience it in moments as pure Happiness or Love. Can this state be spontaneous and continuous? Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Prophet Mohammed, Krishna, Nanak, Rumi, Osho, Krishnamurthy, Ramana Maharishi and millions of others throughout our history have experienced and shared this with us for our benefit, *in different ways*. Everyone can be a Master and Knower, and their knowing be beautifully manifested in their relationships, family and work. This is what we, as modern humans, wish for present and future Humanity.
