### System and order for mutual happiness and wellbeing
We have all kind of material comforts in today's system, yet we are not happy. Why?

> From the current system run by power, needs to emerge a System and Order based on mutual fulfilment and continuity of happiness. We all are found together on Earth. Only and only by realising this fact, can Humanity live safely, happily and mutually fulfilled; in prosperity with rest of planet Earth.

### At Lifemaker, we wish to bring humanity together 
with a shared understanding of Life and the way to live. We wish to establish *a system and order* which solves all our problems and needs - material, mental and spiritual; and ensures mutual fulfillment in continuity; for every child, person, family & Earth; for Good and for all time to come.

### And we believe family is the way to go 
By family, we mean *at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment.*
At Lifemaker we look at family as the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living, Existence and Co-existence.

### Our approach to self-family-social transformation

Our families live by [a shared Way of Life](/values) and [a system and order based approach](/post/approach), based on Wisdom. We live by fulfilling each other cooperatively and complimentarily. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living and growing with us that way. 

> Have a look at [the proposed blueprint](/post/approach) for our approach.
