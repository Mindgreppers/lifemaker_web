### A Holistic Human order for mutual happiness and wellbeing

Human's true nature is Happiness, but we are not peaceful or happy today. Most are caught in a blind race or rage, expecting happiness from actions, not knowing that Happiness is available equally to everyone by default. We divide, compare and compete, not realising that we are all found together; same and similar; in co-existence. 

> The previous big leap in Human evolution was in materialism and science. The next leap is in Consciousness; reflected as a [Universal Value](/values) based System and Order.

### How can we be happy, prosperous and enlightened together? 

> Have a look at [the proposed blueprint](/post/approach)

*We believe family is the way to go. And the change starts with yours.*

By family, we mean *at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment.* Family is the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living, Existence and Co-existence. A family is the basic unit of an integrated human society.

We welcome curious families, couples (and also individuals) from any background to spend time and collaborate with us in India, or on the [online Ashram](http://www.ashram.lifemaker.us).

## We are thankful 
to all relegions, messengers, philosophers, teachers, scientists, social reformers and all benevolent beings, for their contribution towards human evolution and upliftment. We wish to see their work to completion. We want to see Humanity reach its full potential. 

## Call to the tribe

Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when in sync with own true nature. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
