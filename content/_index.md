## An undivided Humanity
### A Human order for mutual happiness and wellbeing
Why is Human and Humanity not at peace or happy today? Those with wealth & power, and those without - they are all unhappy. Why is living becoming more and more unsustainable and strensuous? Why is there conflict all around - in Self, family, Humanity and with Nature too? Humans have been enlightened occasionally throughout history, but their teachings have been for the individual. So far Humanity has not been presented with a Holistic System and Order where every family and child gets a fertile environment for nurture, happiness and enlightenment. **How can there be happiness in continuity, and as a timeless Human tradition?** 

> Time has come to take our ancestors work forward. To grow together, from individuals to Family. Time has come to build a mutual understanding of Life as-it-is; to help each other be nurtured, fulfilled and happy; to be a Universal Family of enlightened families, in a peaceful play of Existence with Co-existence.

### At Lifemaker, we envision a Holistic working model based on which Humanity can co-exist in a mutually fulfilling and happy manner, in balance with nature; as an undying Human tradition. 

We wish to establish *a system and order*, via a culture of mutual co-operation and family based approach, which solves all our problems and needs - material, mental and spiritual; and ensures mutual fulfillment in continuity; for every child, person, family & Earth; for Good and for all time to come.

### And we believe family is the way to go 
By family, we mean *at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment.*
At Lifemaker we look at family as the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living, Existence and Co-existence.

### Our approach to self-family-social transformation

Our families live by [a shared Way of Life](/values) and [a system and order based approach](/post/approach), based on Wisdom. We live by fulfilling each other cooperatively and complimentarily. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living and growing with us that way. 

> Have a look at [the proposed blueprint](/post/approach) for our approach.
