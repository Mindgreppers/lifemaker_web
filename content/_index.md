## Undivided Humanity. Thriving family. Holistic order. 
### For continuity of happiness
Happiness is what we truly seek behind all our endeavors. It is right between us, but disconnected from our Nature, we look for it elsewhere - obviously in futility. Today, we as individuals, families, states, race (and Earth in totality) are neither healthy nor happy. Even food and survival is becoming a bigger challenge with every passing day. The environment is becoming poisonous for both the body and the mind. While our current system and order has material comforts (for some), we are still not happy. 

**How can all of us be mutually fulfilled and happy together?** 


> When the nature of Consciousness/Matter, Existence/Co-existence, Human/Humanity is understood, comes knowledge. From knowledge comes wisdom. From wisdom emerges Rightful Living. The proof of the Life's understanding is reflected in the Living based on mutual fulfillment and continuity of happiness. 

## We need a social web of transcendental co-existence
At Lifemaker, we wish to bring humanity together with a shared understanding of Life, and the way to live. *A new order* which solves all our problems and needs - material, mental and spiritual; and paves way for real progress; for every child, person, family & Earth; for Good and for all time to come.

## And we believe family is the way to go 
By family, we mean *at least two people committed to being together for Life.*
Family is the fundamental unit of society. Comfort, protection and love are found first and foremost in family. It is the launchpad for leaping in the larger World, and also the landing site of trust and retreat. At Lifemaker we look at it as the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living, Existence and Co-existence.

## We include everyone
Our families believe that all humanity and Life is One Family. And our [way of Life](/values) is to be inclusive, integral and see everyone with unchanging Love. 

## Our approach to self-family-social transformation

Our families live by [a way of Life based on a Universal Value System](/values). Our member families live by fulfilling each other cooperatively and complimentarily. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living and growing with us that way. 

> Have a look at [the proposed blueprint](/post/approach) for our approach.
