## A holistic order for continuity of happiness
Happiness is what we truly seek behind all our endeavors. While our current system and order has material comforts (for some), we are still not happy. So how can we be truly happy? 

> We can be truly happy in tradition, by understanding Life, and living with Wisdom 

### At Lifemaker, we wish to bring humanity together 
with a shared understanding of Life and the way to live together. *A system and order* which solves all our problems and needs - material, mental and spiritual; and ensures mutual fulfillment in continuity; for every child, person, family & Earth; for Good and for all time to come.

### And we believe family is the way to go 
By family, we mean *at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment.*
At Lifemaker we look at family as the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living, Existence and Co-existence.

### Our approach to self-family-social transformation

Our families live by a way of Life [based on a Universal Value System](/values) and [a systematic approach](/post/approach). Our member families live by fulfilling each other cooperatively and complimentarily. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living and growing with us that way. 

> Have a look at [the proposed blueprint](/post/approach) for our approach.
