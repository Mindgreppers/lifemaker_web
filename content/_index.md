## Undivided Humanity. Thriving family. Holistic order. 
### For continuity of happiness
Happiness is what we truly seek behind all our endeavors. It is right between us, but disconnected from our Nature, we look for it elsewhere - obviously in futility. Today, we as individuals, families, states, race (and Earth in totality) are neither healthy nor happy. Even food and survival is becoming a bigger challenge with every passing day. The environment is becoming poisonous for both the body and the mind. **While our current system and order has material comforts (for some), we are still missing out on happiness. How can all of us be mutually fulfilled and happy together?** 

> Once we understand Life and the way to Live, it becomes spontaneous to be in mutually fulfilling co-existence; as beings of happiness. 

### What we really need is an enlightening new order
Personal, familial, social; built on top of the existing order; taking forward learnings from our relegions, saints, philosophers, scientists and ancestors; and applying a timeless, total solution to all our problems.

## At Lifemaker, we are seeking our family of Enlightened Living
A web of families sharing an environment, a blueprint, which infuses safety, nutrition, holistic living and trascendence in every child, family and their environment. We wish to setup a tradition, where there is continuity of happiness and mutual fulfillment; in co-existence. Every human (family) who wishes to live happier in co-existence, wishes to see the picture in an open frame, is welcome to connect with us or meet us.

#### We believe family is the way to go 
because family is the fundamental unit of society, and is also the first place for comfort, security and love. Those of us who feel this way, are evolving and implementing a *holistic, family based understanding & approach to Existence and Co-existence, in an open frame*. Such englightened families connecting together locally and globally, will form a new web for the transcendental Humanity. 

# Our approach

Our families live by [a way of Life based on a Universal Value System](/values). Our member families live by fulfilling each other cooperatively and complimentarily. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living and growing with us that way. Have a look at [the proposed blueprint](/post/approach).
