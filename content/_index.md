## Humanity coming together to develop a shared understanding of Human, Life & Existence, and to establish and live by an Order of mutual fulfilment and happiness in continuity

> Have a look at [the proposed approach](/post/approach). Our approach is objective, integral and holistic. The centerpoint is Family Education where entire family learns about nature of Self, Life and Universal Values. Every such Enlightened Family -the unit of Society - shares the goal for mutual wellbeing and sustainability in Co-existence. It takes care of itself and also its neighbours, Environment and entire Earth in meaningful ways. By enlightening one family at a time (and inspiring the rest from their behavior in living), we wish to see Human evolution reach the final stage of its development - *Fully realised consciousness and bliss in continuity*.

**Family workshops - June 1st - 12th in Dharamsala, HP, India. Contact us to register by 15th May. At least two people from every family must come. We welcome curious individuals too, but families are preferred.**

We invite curious families and individuals from any background to understand Life, Existence and Co-existence & Human needs. We welcome every curious and compassionate person and family, to join our network from their homes, farms and community spaces; both online and offline. While we welcome you to our base, you can also invite us to meet your family, friends and community; or be part of this movement starting from our online forum called Ashram. 

We are hosting an online social network for remote help, coordination and cooperation. It is being called the Ashram and will be up soon. This forum is open to everyone, and is a place of trust, for mutual help, life advice, discussions on health, sustainability, permaculture, body and consciousness, Human and Humanity, Existence and Co-existence, family, conceptual model (Education), operating model (Production and Exchange), working model (Universal Values), Lifemaker and more such topics.  

Our on ground pilot is based in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. We are conducting workshops with local families to develop a shared understanding and starting to bond and live together with mutual cooperation. 

*We are looking at evolving and implementing a complete solution to all Human needs - from matter to consciousness. This movement is a fresh start. While the founders and their network have a top level understanding and proposal, this can not be the work of a handful. The movement needs the curiosity and involvement from the larger humanity to manifest and grow.*

## We are thankful 
to all relegions, messengers, philosophers, teachers, scientists, social reformers and all benevolent beings, for their contribution towards human evolution and upliftment. We wish to see their work to completion. We want to see Humanity reach its full potential. 

## Call to the tribe

Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when in sync with own true nature. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
