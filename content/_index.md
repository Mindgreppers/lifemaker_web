> **The essence of Human Life is happiness. Yet Humanity is not happy today. We face a painful present and are laying seeds for a catastrophic future. Being the only animal in knowledge state, we have the potential to solve any problem and co-exist happily. [We need a positive and sustainable change](/post/background). To realise our true potential as Humanity, we need [a systematic and processible approach](/post/approach)**. The model has to be objective, sensible, integral and holistic. And it has to cover all aspects of Life and Living - from material to consciousness. This model must be understandable and happily acceptable to anyone and everyone. Family is the unit of society. Hence our approach is family based, where enlightened, resolved, happy and prosperous families come together to form an undivided Human society. **We wish to see Humanity reach the final stage of evolution where social consciousness is fully evolved and can be witness in a Value based Living Order.** And the time for that to happen is now, or else it may be too late for us on Earth. To establish a proven working blueprint, we are doing a pilot from Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India.

**Family workshops - June 1st - 12th in Dharamsala, HP, India. Contact us to register by 15th May.** At least two people from every family or friends, must come together. We welcome curious individuals too. But at least two visitors are preferred because when two share the same understanding, the evolution is much faster, and the capability of bringing a change is greater. Age no bar. Children especially welcome.

**Our on ground pilot is based in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India.** We are conducting workshops with local families to develop a shared understanding and starting to bond and live together with mutual cooperation. We are in process of talks with some village families to get some land for running our program in parternship. 

**Our online forum (Ashram) will be live soon for global community to connect and collaborate. Anyone can register and participate. It is a place for working towards**

* Mutual help 
* Life advice
* Sustainability and harmony
* Sharing knowledge, understanding and wisdom of Self, Life, Existence and Co-existence 
* Evolution of working, conceptual and operating models (Value based living, family education, sustainable production, exchange, economics, organisation, resource sharing, decision making etc)
* Value based living
* More such topics.  

*We are looking at evolving and implementing a complete solution to all Human needs - from matter to consciousness. This movement is a fresh start. While the founders and their network have a top level understanding and proposal, we need a bigger team as this has to be a collective effort of everyone. The movement needs the curiosity and involvement from the larger humanity to manifest and grow.*

## Call to the tribe

Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when in sync with own true nature. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
