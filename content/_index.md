## Are you truly happy and fulfilled?

*Are you feeling that life (or something to do with you) is not perfect? Are you facing some challenge or question that seem to puzzle you? Do you find yourself wishing for peace of Mind at times? Do you wish for love? Do you feel separate(or anguished) from the World? Do you feel you (or your life, World) need to improve? Are there any goals (or desires) you wish to realise? Do you derive joy in serving others, and wonder how you can serve better? Are you looking to expand your perspective and grow? Do you need help of any kind?* 

> Reaching out to us may be the best thing you do

No matter what is your area of concern, we may be able to channelise help for you. All it takes to get started is a message from you. Read more about the Lifeline feature [here](/lifeline)

*Just like an empty pot can not fill another cup, in order to truly make anyone happy and benefitted, you need to be happy and fulfilled yourself. We are here as your benefactors for the same.*

## All is ONE. ONE is All.
> I am that (indivisible, unborn, undying, formless, eternal Self). 

I am the dot which is the center and the source of the circle on which exist objects like mind, ego-self, body and World. They are same as Me, the Self. Yet, the Self is different from them in the way that it can exist without them, but they can not exist without the Self. Just like gold (the formless) exists without the jewels (forms) made out of it; I exist, without this body, mind and world, which are just like jewels made out of gold, which is the real Me. *Read more about our philosophy [here](/philosophy)*

## What is LifeMaker?
LifeMaker is a movement or family or community, of people, by people and for people, to empower each other 

- to recognise and fulfill: life's purpose, heart's desires, and duties
- to be happy and growing on a moment to moment basis. 
- to discover the non-dual nature of Self and live experientially as the ONE supreme consciouness, the creator, maintainer and destroyer of all objects including the mind, body and world.
- to lead humanity's evolution to higher consciousness which but peace, love, unity, happiness, cooperation and abundance.
- to establish a just, harmonious and efficient social and economic order
- to make the world sustainable for all life forms
- to simplify the puzzle called life into a spontaneous expression of the Self

We are here to empower those who wish to bring meaning and happiness in their lives or in lives of others. Alone, as we all are in today's individualistic world, we are weak. Together, i.e. truly together, and well organised, as a global family of Love and Light, we are infinitely powerful and efficient. Only our sense of separation from the Existence makes us feel lonely and negative. Heaven is right here on Earth. Let us do the unvieling.

## Call to the tribe

> The humanly crisis, and the solution

We are looking for those who resonate with us, to join us in the journey of Self realisation, love and eternal happiness.

## We aspire to live in a certain way

> Please take time to review our [charter of the Way of Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0).

It is a shared aspiration of an attitude deemed fit for living a fulfilled and harmonious life – individually and socially. The charter is maintained by the Lifemaker community, forever evolving and improving. If you are considering joining us, please make an effort to review the charter. Let us know how it resonates with you, how can it be improved etc.

## Three kinds of Lifemaker members
#### Elders (or Budhdhas)

By elders we mean the Self realised souls, who shine forth with unblemished illumination of the Revelation. Their consciouness and experience is that of Oneness, like Buddha. Lifemaker has the blessing to have some truly Wise – Realised and Selfless souls, living in infinitude, here to guide and advice us as senior family members. Some of our current elders are – Ranganathan Chari from Kodaikanal, Anish Joel from Dharamsala, Pran Krsna Baba, Nimay Nitai and others from Radhakund and Vrindavana, Swamiji Harish Karun from Tang, Dharamsala and some unnamed ones. They are growing in number as our tribe connections grow.

#### Seekers (or seeders)
All Lifemakers, except the elders, are seekers. They are seeking the source of ultimate happiness and abundance in life. 
You can join us as a seeker of the Self, or one who is simply looking to improve their life. You do not have to claim to be an expert in any domain. The day you feel ready to share something with the world as an expert, we will support you in the transition. Our current seeders are helping us by donating funds, spreading the word, ideation and design and technology for our upcoming apps.

#### Experts
As Lifemakers, we wish to be available to humanity to help them do well in any aspect of existence. From the dot (the Self) to the circle (life activities). Everyone has something to share. If you are good at something, anything, and wish to share the same for others' benefit, please get in touch with us. Read more about the skills we currently have in the [Lifeline section](/lifeline) But really, we are happy to add your unique skill to the list. It could be making paper toys to rockets that go to Mars. Anything that you are good at, and is useful for someone to learn.
