## Are you truly happy and fulfilled?

*Are you feeling that life (or something to do with you) is not perfect? Are you facing some challenge or question that seem to puzzle you? Do you find yourself wishing for peace of Mind at times? Do you wish for love? Do you feel separate(or anguished) from the World? Do you feel you, your life or the World need to get better in any way? Are there any goals (or desires) you wish to realise? Do you derive joy in serving others, and wonder how you can serve better?* 

> Reaching out to us may be the best thing you do

No matter what is your area of concern, we may be able to channelise help for you. All it takes is a message from you. Read more about the Lifeline service [here](/lifeline)

*Just like an empty pot can not fill another cup, in order to truly make anyone happy and benefitted, you need to be happy and fulfilled yourself. We are here as your benefactors for the same.*

## What is LifeMaker?

LifeMaker can be called a movement, family or community, of people, by people and for people, from across the World, to empower each other 

- to conquer the Mind and its negative tendencies, and simplify the puzzle called life into a spontaneous expression of the (real) Self
- to be happy, healthy and completely fulfilled
- to pursue own creativity and expression for the benefit of the personal self or the world, in a fully supportive environment
- to realise absolute freedom and live in the present, free from attachments to past, imaginations of future or expectations from the world
- to inspire friends, colleages and family as an example of positive virtues like blissful consciousness, peace, love, unity, happiness, equanimity, cooperation and abundance.
- to establish a just, harmonious, decentralised, efficient, progressive, inclusive and abundant social and economic order as ONE global village
- to keep the (abstract and physical) environment clean, healthy and sustenable for everyone
- to discover, create and share abundance with each other
- to maintain a fertile environment in the present, and plant healthy seeds for the future.

> Please take time to review our [charter of the Way of Life](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0).

It is a shared aspiration of an attitude deemed fit for living a fulfilled and harmonious life – individually and socially. The charter is maintained by the Lifemaker community. It will forever be evolving and improving, in an open manner. If you are considering joining us, please make an effort to review the charter. Let us know how it resonates with you, how can it be improved etc.

We are here to empower those who wish to bring meaning, happiness and growth in their lives or in lives of others. Alone, as we all are in today's individualistic world, we are weak. Together, i.e. truly together, and well organised as a global family of Love and Light, we are infinitely powerful, and can grow much faster. Only our sense of separation from the Existence makes us feel lonely and negative. Heaven is right here on Earth. Let us do the unvieling.

## All is ONE. ONE is All.

> I am that (indivisible, unborn, undying, formless, eternal Self). 

I am the center of the circle on which exist objects like mind, body and World. Like gold exists without its jewels (forms), but the jewels can not exist without the Gold, I exist even when there is no thought, body or world but they can not exist without me. I am them. But they are not me. Because I am eternal and unchanging, the source of everything, which exists also in deep sleep as well in dreams - only I am real. The mind, body and World have a lifespan, and are forever changing. Hence how can they be called real? *Read more about our philosophy [here](/philosophy)*

*If we truly realised this One Absolute Truth (the center point) passed by the teachings of all relegions, sages and prophets in different ways, suited for their times and places, we would not be fighting over issues at the circle, because we will all be aligned at the source, the center, the dot. There will be peace, prosperity and happiness for humanity.*

## Call to the tribe

> The humanly crisis, and the solution

We are looking for those who resonate with us, to join us in the journey of Self realisation, love and eternal happiness.

## Three kinds of Lifemaker members
#### Elders (or Budhdhas)

By elders we mean the Self realised souls, who shine forth with unblemished illumination of the Revelation. Their consciouness and experience is that of Oneness, like Buddha. Lifemaker has the blessing to have some truly Wise – Realised and Selfless souls, living in infinitude, here to guide and advice us as senior family members. Some of our current elders are – Ranganathan Chari from Kodaikanal, Anish Joel from Dharamsala, Pran Krsna Baba, Nimay Nitai and others from Radhakund and Vrindavana, Swamiji Harish Karun from Tang, Dharamsala and some unnamed ones. They are growing in number as our tribe connections grow.

#### Seekers (or seeders)
All Lifemakers, except the elders, are seekers. They are seeking the source of ultimate happiness and abundance in life. 
You can join us as a seeker of the Self, or one who is simply looking to improve their life. You do not have to claim to be an expert in any domain. The day you feel ready to share something with the world as an expert, we will support you in the transition. Our current seeders are helping us by donating funds, spreading the word, ideation and design and technology for our upcoming apps.

#### Experts
As Lifemakers, we wish to be available to humanity to help them do well in any aspect of existence. From the dot (the Self) to the circle (life activities). Everyone has something to share. If you are good at something, anything, and wish to share the same for others' benefit, please get in touch with us. Read more about the skills we currently have in the [Lifeline section](/lifeline) But really, we are happy to add your unique skill to the list. It could be making paper toys to rockets that go to Mars. Anything that you are good at, and is useful for someone to learn.
