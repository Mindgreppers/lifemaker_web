### Undivided Humanity. Thriving family. Holistic order. 
> Lifemaker is a collective way of life for Good; in co-existence. It is a holistic solution to all personal, social and environmental problems, in a human (family) centric approach. We are evolving a standard package for families, for education, enlightenment, health and co-living. This replicable and scalable blueprint can be adopted and verified by families, their neighborhood and all Humanity, all across the world. 

## A friendly Lifeline is here for you 

*Interested? You can ask us anything. And we shall together explore and investigate.* 

No matter what is your question, need or suggestion, we will love to hear from you. Reach out to us through [Lifeline service](/lifeline) today! Our forum will be up soon. 

## Our approach

Our family understands and lives by [a Universal Value System](/values). Our members live to fulfill each other, Humanity and Earth in every meaningful way possible. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living that way.

- **Meet with an open frame, to understand and See reality (Life, Living, Existence, Co-existence) as-it-is**
  - Attend one of our introductory workshops of 7 days
  - We will do Existence based human centric contemplation. It is an alternative to Materialism/Science and Theism/Spiritualism. It equips us with clarity for every dimension of our lives via realization knowledge. It has a resolution to our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems. 
  - If understood, it will enable a family (together - humanity) to make every relegion successful and our wise ancestors proud.
- **Once the picture is seen in the open frame, start applying the Wisdom in Living** 
  - Identify and serve the *real* needs and spend least on entertainment.
  - Live in a cooperative, complimentary, justful and mutually fulfilling way as a family, with its environment.
- **Prove and replicate a standard model for existential and co-existential [education](/model) and [value based co-living](/values)**
  - In a systematic way
  - The family is the fundamental Unit, instead of individual
  - Our package will empower families on health and nutrition, production, exchange, education and enlightenment
  - The package is aimed to help them live in a mutually fulfilling way; within itself and with its neighborhood
  - We are kick-starting from villages of Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. Looking for at least ten local families to opt in, in coming weeks. Once the model kicks in with them, we move forward. 
- **Live at grassroots with village based communities; in symbiosis with each other and all Nature** 
  - Share and utilise land, water and resources in the right manner
  - Be as much locally self-reliant as possible
  - Support the needs of local member families
  - Conduct residential programs for immersive co-living, skills and knowledge sharing
  - Member families in cities are also invited to live by the Lifemaker way in the context of cities.
- **Have complimentary production, exchange and cooperation at local level**
  - Emphasise on Natural farming, eco-businesses/services, living skills and physical work
  - Produce, share and use justfully, and as locally as possible
- **Keep learning and evolving** 
  - Have regular community gatherings to discuss on Life and current state of affairs in Living
  - Provide facility for internet access and remote communication
  - Have workshops, programs and events for exposure, skills and knowledge
- **Connect and cooperate globally as Enlightened Human family**
  - Develop tools and means for remote communication and collaboration
  - Fund travel expenses for learning or teaching
  - Support member communities and families for safety, prosperity and evolution
  - Heal ourselves and all Earth; conserve resources and use rightfully
- **Create a timeless tradition which** 
  - Is proven to ensure continuous happiness and mutual fulfillment for Human society and Earth
  - Is holistic, integral, rational and open
  - Works as a justful and wise system and order.
  - Guides every new born child on the path of everlasting happiness in justful co-existence, for as long as humanity lasts (Hopefully much more than a hundred years as some say).
