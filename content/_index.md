The intention of Lifemaker is to unite families across the Earth as an undivided society in Universal orderliness, by the thread of shared understanding of Universal Values, Life (Self as human) and Existence (as Co-existence). We wish to see every human family and humanity reach the pinnacle of consciousness evolution, where we witness a never ending tradition of Shubh (happiness, contentment, peace and bliss) in co-existence on Earth.

**The five point working model of universal orderliness** covers: 

* **Education and research** - Free education for families and research, covering value based consciousness development (the foundation) and skills/knowledge useful for living.
* **Health** - Healthy lifestyle and natural healing practices for both mind and body.
* **Eco-production** - Universal values and local resources based production and services, that don't harm Earth, water, air, nature or any humans.
* **Exchange** - Need and giving based exchange (instead of profit based). Families work to produce more than their needs, and thereby every family sustains as a giver and reciever of abundance.
* **Justice** - Universal values based code of conduct for mutual fulfillment. Constitution and laws for decentralised-local-global cooperation and decision making.

**The intention is to witness** a generation to generation (tradition) based _continuity_ of

* **All round wellbeing in self, family, society, states and inter-state (United humane nation)** so that every level of society witnesses _Shubh_, which is 
  * _All round resolution with happiness_
  * _Abundance with contentment_
  * _Mutual confidence (fearlessness) with peace_
  * _Justful (mutually fulfilling) co-existence with bliss_
* **Healthy Earth** rich with natural resources and fertile soil to feed everyone and fulfill justful
needs
* **Healthy air and water** for every inhabitant of Earth, to breath and drink well

#### What is family?
Generally speaking, a family, whether of blood or heart, is a group which lives together with love and care, and its members find themselves assured of safety, mutual fulfillment, growth and happiness in their mutuality. 
This is the environment which we seek for humanity, as undivided human society in Universal Orderliness. 


With 100 families of an area coming together based on shared objective understanding, the model gets proven. With just two families, the process kickstarts. As every family continues to understand and move forward in awakening progression, the proof of understanding is visible more and more in the wisdom, prosperity, confidence and mutual fulfilment with which it lives; and in the happiness, contentment, peace and co-existential bliss that it experiences. 

#### The model
To realise our true potential we need [a systematic process and approach](/post/approach). The model has to be objective, sensible, integral and holistic. And it has to cover all aspects of Life and Living - from material to consciousness. This model must be understandable and happily acceptable to anyone and everyone. Family is the unit of society. Hence our approach is family based.

#### Do you think on these lines?
Does We include me or me include We? **What is the higest pursuit of every human including me?** What do we want most, if not Shubh (happiness, contentment, peace and bliss)? Does everyone's Shubh lie in my Shubh, or does my Shubh lie in everyone's Shubh? Whatever we are doing, is it really fulfilling us? **Are we doing things happily or in order to be happy?** Why is society broken and families are breaking apart? 

What good or bad am I doing for the Earth and environment? **If I really love my children and their children to be, then what am I doing for giving them better air, water, earth and society than what I got?** Does a big bank account, comfort of the body, loss of another, gossip, comparison, competition, social show off etc. give my family any resolution or happiness? Or is it holistic understanding of Life, confidence in each other and mutual fulfillment in relationships? **Is happiness from the body or the mind?** _Who am I as human? What is Existence as co-existence? What is the right way to live? How can I and my family be own masters and knowers of existence, instead of blind followers?_

**Have you ever wondered where does the power of finding the solutions for positive change lie - in the existing system, businessmen, relegions, governments or some other external agent or agency with superpowers? Or does it lie within me and my family?**

## Call to the tribe

> Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when we are in sync with own true nature, and it reflects in fulfilment of our relationships. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
