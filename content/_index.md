## Humankind uniting with shared understanding and all round resolution

### A society which ensures a beautiful and meaningful life for everyone

> An understanding and relationship based society (family). Systems of holistic education and good self governance. A just and equitable society. Shared prosperity with nature.

The aim of Lifemaker movement is to develop the right understanding (truth) within oneself and to live by it, as individuals â€“ on our own right, i.e. with self-discipline; and contribute to a society which ensures the wellbeing of all in continuity, i.e. a self-governing, undivided society which is just and equitable.

For realizing this we need naturally acceptable, shared understanding of 

* The nature of self as human
* Existence as coexistence and 
* The way to live with good governance, in a family and grassroots centric way, covering education, health, production/services, distribution, relationships and nurture of nature.

### Some readings

* [Proposed approach](/approach)
* [The proposals for your reflection](/proposals) 
* [The proposed six dimensional working model cum blueprint](/working-model)
* [Consensus and self discipline based Self Governance](/self-governance)

### Disclaimer: There is no us and them here

#### This is not a sect, religion or community

#### This is Undivided World Family
Here we are not talking of any sect or religion. The object of Undivided human society unconditionally includes and loves every human as part of it, because only with unconditional acceptance we start to be undivided. And reality is that we are indeed undivided by nature, but only divided by our imaginary boundaries and conflicts. 

So, everyone is invited to participate in this program by getting introduced to the proposals and attaining self realization and understanding of the same.

### Coming together with a shared, universal perspective is our need, opportunity and the only refuge

*We may have different viewpoints on nature of Self and reality, different skin color, occupations and opinions, but as humans we are all fundamentally same and thereafter similar. Through honest objective and subjective inquiry humanity as society and each human is bound to understand and realise Truth in the same way, because we exist in the same Truth. Our sameness as humans, the onlyness of Truth (Existence in which we co-exist), honest self inquiry for Truth, and agreement on the way to live, is the (only) unifying ground, which will provide Life the absolute and permanent resolution it needs and seeks.*
