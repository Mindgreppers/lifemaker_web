### A Holistic Human order and tradition for mutual fulfilment and happiness in continuity

Happiness is our true nature. Most of us are caught in a blind race or rage, desiring happiness from actions or objects, not knowing that it is available to everyone all the time. We have not realised *that we are all found together; same and similar; on this Earth; in Co-existence.* Not attentive to the fact that in co-existence everything is connected as an indivisible whole; we divide, compare, compete and fight, as if the loss of others or environment doesn't affect us, or will rather give us some benefit. In reality, there is no Holistic gain at other's loss. We play power games and are ruled by power. We have not (collectively) realised the spontaneously happy nature of Life, in which all of us can co-exist peacefully and mutually fulfilled. Our families are breaking. Human body or consciousness is not in a healthy state. Humanity is facing an imminent extinction. The message is clear - "Learn or Burn". And we don't have much time. **Lifemaker is an invitation to Humanity to learn and cooperate starting NOW, so that human seed continues to thrive in an timeless tradition of enlightenment, justful living and happiness in continuity.**

> The previous big leap in Human evolution was in Materialism and Science. The next leap is in Consciousness; reflected as a [Universal Value](/values) based System and Order.

### How can we be happy, prosperous and enlightened together? 

> Have a look at [the proposed approach](/post/approach)

*We believe family is the way to go. And the change starts with yours.*

By family, we mean *at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment.* Family is the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living, Existence and Co-existence. *A family is the basic unit of an integrated human society.*

We welcome curious families, couples (and also individuals) from any background to spend time and collaborate with us in India, or on the [online Ashram](http://www.ashram.lifemaker.us).

to all relegions, messengers, philosophers, teachers, scientists, social reformers and all benevolent beings, for their contribution towards human evolution and upliftment. We wish to see their work to completion. We want to see Humanity reach its full potential. 

## Call to the tribe

Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when in sync with own true nature. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
