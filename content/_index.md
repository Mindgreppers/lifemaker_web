## Are you truly happy and fulfilled?
Are you (plus your family and relationships) happy all the time or only for some fleeting moments? Do you do actions in happiness or do you do actions in order to be happy? Do you wonder who you truly are? Do you know what you really, really want or your purpose? Do you suffer for any reason? Do you question the status quo? Do you wish your family and relationships to do well? Do you wish the World to be a happier place and all life to flourish in mutual fulfillment? 

> **We are here for you, to together realise the essence of existence and co-existence, feel safe and secure in a mutually fulfilling and justful environment, and be in a state of natural and spontaneous happiness all the time. We wish the best for every human, every human family, all life on Earth and all the future life to come.**

## What is LifeMaker?

> A global family for mutual fulfillment, enlightenment and happiness, glued by the spirit of Oneness and Integration - **All is One. One is All.**

#### Continuity of happiness, abundance, mutual fulfillment and solutions in totality
We can all agree that everyone would like to be happy and fulfilled all the time. But that isn't happening for most of us, even in the presence of religious, philosophical and spiritual teachings by masters and prophets, and also the work done recently towards economy, education and "development". The state of global affairs is that each family (or idividual) is lovelessly left to fend for themselves. The same applies to all animal life, which has been deemed fit to stay in zoos and become extinct from nature. The imbalance between human and rest of animals and plants is making life unsustainable or degenrative for most species on earth. Why are we so selfish or unwise? Why are we distracted from our natural state of happiness by conflicts, struggle of survival, money, power, fame, selfishness and addictions and illusions at various levels. We need a justful and complete social solution that can *truly* be effective towards ensuring love, safety, nutrition, trust, mutual fulfillment, sustained happiness and enlightened living in the entirety of our co-existence. 

#### Our values and aspirations 
Our community aspires to live by [a Unversal Value System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0). We are a non-commercial, self-sustainable, of people and for people family. We are doing this for compassion (only), and with wisdom. We make you and you make us. We are here to tenderly empower humanity to

- realise the nature of Self (existence and co-existence)
- abide in continuous and mutual happiness, fulfillment, peace and love
- apply justful and complete solutions for human and environmental needs
  - food, nutrition and energy
  - healthy environment to support all life forms
  - distant travel and communication
  - safety, comfort, love, trust, peace

## Our approach

- Come together as a Universal family made of smaller family units
- Work towards mutual fulfillment, justful living and Self realisation in a systematic way
- Adopt a [family based education approach](/model) for existential and co-existential education and co-living 
- Act with wisdom and mutual support. 
- Help each other compassionately and wisely, within micro unit families and as the Universal family
- Live by a [Universal value system](/values) for harmonious, enlightening and abundant life
- Co-ownership, conservation and right utilisation of resources
- Natural and locally sustainable ways of food, production and cultivation of energy 
- An internal economy that ensures financial abundance for the participating families


Alone, as we all are in today's individualistic world, we are weak. Together, i.e. truly together as ONE, as a global family of Love and Light, well connected and organised as families of justful living, we can create a shared ecosystem and energy field, which will help each one of us tap into our infinite potential and bliss, with much greater ease. Only our sense of separation from the Existence makes us feel limited, lonely and negative. But co-existence is with Existence, and not separate from it. Bliss, spontaneity and love is our true nature, only shrouded by our viel of ignorance. Happiness is indeed within and between us. Let us do the unvieling together!

## Philosophy of Lifemaker: Who am I really?

> **I am** (indivisible, integral, unborn, undying, formless, limitless, timeless, eternal Self, present equally, everywhere). I am not only this body, mind or ego. I am ompnipresent Existence within which is co-existence. I am also present in void, where there is no-thing.

We wish this to be be a direct experience and realisation for everyone. We wish everyone to be a Master and Knower, with their knowing manifested in their relationships, family and work.
