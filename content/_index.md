Lifemaker is a not-for-profit collaboration of self governed families, living in and for *universal good*. It is neither a commune nor a cult. It is the model in application for undivided and enlightened human society. The family members participate in, upkeep and co-host a complimentary and cooperative environment for sustainability, holistic nurture and universal consciousness. The working model, adopted by every family, has the following five dimensions: 

* Education - Understanding and realising the nature of self/life/human, existence as co-existence only and humane values. Also, useful knowledge & skills for living.
* Health - mental and physical
* Production - products and services which are friendly to nature and health
* Exchange - share abundance and be locally sustainable by every family producing more than the family's need
* Justice - Laws for humane value based conduct and cooperation

With 100 families of an area coming together based on shared objective understanding, the model gets proven. With just two families, the process kickstarts. As every family continues to understand and move forward in awakening progression, the proof of understanding is visible more and more in the wisdom, prosperity, confidence and mutual fulfilment with which it lives; and in the happiness, contentment, peace and co-existential bliss that it experiences. 

#### The human wish and required action
Lifemaker families realise the need for shift in consciousness - both within, in family and in society. To realise our true potential we need [a systematic process and approach](/post/approach). The model has to be objective, sensible, integral and holistic. And it has to cover all aspects of Life and Living - from material to consciousness. This model must be understandable and happily acceptable to anyone and everyone. Family is the unit of society. Hence our approach is family based, where enlightened, resolved, happy and prosperous families come together to form an undivided Human society. **We wish to see Humanity reach the final stage of evolution where social consciousness is fully evolved and the evidence is in society's Value based Living Order.** And the time for that to happen is now, or else it may be too late for us on Earth. To establish a proven working blueprint that can scale to all Earth as a timeless tradition, Lifemaker team is doing a pilot from Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India.

#### Do you think on these lines?
Who am I? What is the total object of knowing (Truth in totality)? Can I understand and experience it on my own, without blindly following the dictacts of a Guru, priest or society? Do I also suffer? Why? Why is humanity suffering today? Why do we not respect and love each other and nature? Why do the relationships in families and society remain unfulfilled or get broken? Why is the Earth and environment in such a bad shape? If I pass on Earth in worse condition to my children than how I found it, then do I really love my children? Does money and material comfort give me happiness? Or is happiness a feature of my mind? Can happiness be felt in silo by a unit, or is it felt in relation with co-existence? 
**Have you ever wondered where does the power of finding the solutions for positive change lie - in the existing system, businessmen, relegions, governments or some other external agent or agency with superpowers? Or does it lie within me?**

## Call to the tribe

> Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when we are in sync with own true nature, and it reflects in fulfilment of our relationships. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
