## Shared understanding of Human, Life, Existence and Co-existence. Humanity in mutual fulfilment and sustainable happiness.

*Many > Sequence > Arrange > Pattern > System > System and Order*

> **Humanity is not happy and faces a grim and unsustainable future. We need a positive and sustainable change.** Read more on [why we need a change](/post/background) and [Lifemaker's approach to manifest it](/post/approach). Lifemaker's solution for Humanity is objective, integral and holistic, covering all aspects of Life - from material to consciousness; and is meant to be understandable and agreeable for any family from any background. Our way to spread the understanding is through families, though we welcome curious individuals too. **We want things to be the way they should be.** Every family will be empowered and supported via Life Education and Value based Social Order. It will take care of itself, its Environment and Earth in wise ways. It will inspire its neighbors based on its happiness and Value based behavior in co-existence. **We wish to see Human evolution reach the final stage of its development - Fully realised Human consciousness in Value based Living Order.** And the time for that to happen is now, or else it may be too late for us on Earth.

**Family workshops - June 1st - 12th in Dharamsala, HP, India. Contact us to register by 15th May.** At least two people from every family or friends, must come together. We welcome curious individuals too. But at least two visitors are preferred because when two share the same understanding, the evolution is much faster, and the capability of bringing a change is greater. Age no bar. Children especially welcome.

**Our on ground pilot is based in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India.** We are conducting workshops with local families to develop a shared understanding and starting to bond and live together with mutual cooperation. We are in process of talks with some village families to get some land for running our program in parternship. 

**Our online social network will be live soon. It is meant to help people connect, cooperate and collaborate with each other from their homes, farms and community spaces, in the following ways. It is open to everyone, with or without a shared understanding of Life. It is a place for working towards **

* Mutual help 
* Life advice
* Sustainability and harmony
* Sharing knowledge, understanding and wisdom of Self, Life, Existence and Co-existence 
* Evolution of working, conceptual and operating models (Value based living, family education, sustainable production, exchange, economics, organisation, resource sharing, decision making etc)
* Value based living
* More such topics.  

*We are looking at evolving and implementing a complete solution to all Human needs - from matter to consciousness. This movement is a fresh start. While the founders and their network have a top level understanding and proposal, this has to be a collective effort of everyone. The movement needs the curiosity and involvement from the larger humanity to manifest and grow.*

to all relegions, messengers, philosophers, teachers, scientists, social reformers and all benevolent beings, for their contribution towards human evolution and upliftment. We wish to see their work to completion. We want to see Humanity reach its full potential. 

## Call to the tribe

Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when in sync with own true nature. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, we can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of Consciousness; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way.
