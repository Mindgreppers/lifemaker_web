## A friendly Lifeline is here for you 

No matter what is your question, need, suggestion or concern, we will love to hear from you and do what we can - for we consider you as our Family. Reach out to us through [Lifeline service](/lifeline) today! Our forum will be up soon. 

## Our approach

Our family understands and lives by [a Universal Value System](/values). Our members live to fulfill each other, Humanity and Earth in every meaningful way possible. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living that way.

- **Meet with an open frame, to understand and See reality (Life, Living, Existence, Co-existence) as-it-is**
  - Attend one of our introductory workshops of 7 days
- **Once the picture is seen in the open frame, start applying the Wisdom in Living** 
  - Identify and serve the *real* needs and spend least on entertainment.
  - Live in a cooperative, complimentary, justful and mutually fulfilling way as a family, with its environment.
- **Prove and replicate a standard model for existential and co-existential [education](/model) and [value based co-living](/values)**
  - The family is the fundamental Unit, instead of individual
  - Our package will empower families on health and nutrition, production, exchange, education and enlightenment
  - The package is aimed to help them live in a mutually fulfilling way; within itself and with its neighborhood
  - We are kick-starting from villages of Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. Looking for at least ten local families to opt in, in coming weeks. Once the model kicks in with them, we move forward. 
- **Live at grassroots with village based communities; in symbiosis with each other and all Nature** 
  - Share and utilise land, water and resources in the right manner
  - Be as much locally self-reliant as possible
  - Support the needs of local member families
  - Conduct residential programs for immersive co-living, skills and knowledge sharing
  - Invite families from outside to learn and share
- **Have complimentary production, exchange and cooperation at local level**
  - Emphasise on Natural farming, eco-businesses/services, living skills and physical work
  - Produce, share and use justfully, and as locally as possible
- **Keep learning and evolving** 
  - Have regular community gatherings to discuss on Life and current state of affairs in Living
  - Provide facility for internet access and remote communication
  - Have workshops, programs and events for exposure, skills and knowledge
- **Connect and cooperate globally as Enlightened Human family**
