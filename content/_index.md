## Undivided Humanity. Thriving family. Holistic order. 
### Continuity of happiness
Happiness is what we truly seek behind all our endeavors. It is right between us, but disconnected from our Nature, we look for it elsewhere - obviously in futility. Today, we as individuals, families, states, race (and Earth in totality) are neither healthy nor happy. Even food and survival is becoming a bigger challenge with every passing day. The environment is becoming poisonous for both the body and the mind. When we are so disconnected from our own reality, how can we be in continuity of happiness? 

#### At Lifemaker, we wish to connect families and Humanity for Good

> by the way of Understanding the nature of Existence and Co-existence, and seeing the proof of this understanding or wisdom, in our daily Living. 

#### We believe family is the way to go 
because family is the fundamental unit of society, and is also the first place for comfort, security and love. Those of us who feel this way, are evolving and implementing a *holistic, family based understanding & approach to Existence and Co-existence, in an open frame*. 

#### The aim is to raise consciousness 
to the levels where happiness is an everlasting tradition for every family, in co-existence on Earth. We aim to establish a globally replicable blueprint that solves all the personal, familial, social and environmental issues humanity is facing today.

# Our approach

Our family understands and lives by [a Universal Value System](/values). Our member families live by fulfilling each other in every meaningful way possible. We welcome families, couples (and occasionally individuals) from any background, given they are indeed curious to understand reality as-it-is and ready to commit to living that way.

- **Meet with an open frame, to understand and See reality (Life, Living, Existence, Co-existence) as-it-is**
  - Attend one of our introductory workshops of 7 days
  - We will do Existence based human centric contemplation. It is an alternative to Materialism/Science and Theism/Spiritualism. It equips us with clarity for every dimension of our lives via realization knowledge. It has a resolution to our current personal, familial, social & ecological problems. 
  - If understood, it will enable a family (together - humanity) to make every relegion successful and our wise ancestors proud.
- **Once the picture is seen in the open frame, start applying the Wisdom in Living** 
  - Identify and serve the *real* needs and spend least on entertainment.
  - Live in a cooperative, complimentary, justful and mutually fulfilling way within the family, and with Earth, Environment and neighborhood.
- **Prove and replicate a standard model for existential and co-existential [education](/model) and [value based co-living](/values)**
  - The family is the fundamental Unit, instead of individual
  - Our package will empower families on health and nutrition, production, exchange, education and enlightenment
  - The package is aimed to help them live in a mutually fulfilling and justful way; within itself and with its neighborhood
  - We are kick-starting from villages of Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. Looking for at least ten local families to opt in, in coming weeks. Once the model kicks in with them, we move forward. 
- **Live at grassroots as land based ecological communities; in symbiosis with each other and all Nature** 
  - Share and utilise land, water and resources in the right manner
  - Be as much locally self-reliant as possible
  - Local families support the need of each other as own
  - Conduct residential programs for immersive co-living, skills and knowledge sharing
  - Member families in cities can also live by the Lifemaker way, in the context of cities.
- **Have complimentary production, exchange and cooperation at local level**
  - Emphasise on Natural farming, eco-businesses/services, living skills and physical work
  - Produce, share and use justfully, and as locally as possible
  - Sustain each other
- **Keep learning and evolving** 
  - Have regular community gatherings to discuss on Life and current state of affairs in Living
  - Provide facility for internet access and remote communication
  - Have workshops, programs and events for exposure, skills and knowledge
- **Connect and cooperate globally as Enlightened Human family**
  - Support member families for health, nutrition, prosperity and transformation 
  - Develop tools and means for remote communication and collaboration
  - Fund travel expenses for learning or teaching
  - Heal ourselves and all Earth; conserve resources and use rightfully
- **Create a timeless tradition which** 
  - Is proven to ensure continuous happiness and mutual fulfillment for Human society and Earth
  - Is holistic, integral, rational and open
  - Works as a justful and wise system and order.
  - Guides every new born child on the path of everlasting happiness in justful co-existence, for as long as humanity lasts (Hopefully much more than a hundred years as some say).
