<h2 id="the-time-has-come-for-human-achievement-to-unfold-to-its-full-potential">The time has come for human achievement to unfold to its full potential</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Undivided human society living together and with rest of Nature as One World Family, in a self sustaining traditional environment that nurtures self realization, all round wellbeing, freedom, harmony, fulfillment and happiness, in the individual and relationships. To unite and live in celebration of Existence, with the right feeling, right understanding and shared prosperity at all levels of our inter-being - individual, family, village, area, region, nation state, Undivided Human Society, the World Family (every unit of Nature included).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The time is ripe for collective transition of Humanity towards pinnacle of its conscious evolution - establishment of undivided &ldquo;human&rdquo; society in Swarajya (Self Governance) with a universally &amp; naturally acceptable understanding of Self as Human and Existence as Co-existence, human needs, human value system and the personal and social outlook &amp; solution towards human &amp; environmental needs &amp; problems. Along with this we need the manifesto of undivided society, constitution, policies, systems, infrastructure, and most importantly we need member individuals, families to understand the concept and program and thereby join, collaborate, help others understand, reform the Self, family, village, neighborhood, region, state &amp; collaborate in different areas of work from all across the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here we are not talking of any sect or religion. Undivided human society unconditionally includes and loves every human as part of it, because only then is it undivided. And reality is that we are indeed undivided by nature, but only divided by our imaginary boundaries and conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Every human&rsquo;s deepest inspiration is to live with a feeling of harmony, happiness and fulfillment in continuity. Humankind&rsquo;s need is a social culture, environment and tradition that fosters the same, in a systematic and orderly way, naturally acceptable and consensually agreed upon by every human being.</em></p>

<p>This is an of Human Society, by Human Society and for <em>Human Society and the World</em> movement, not to be ever owned by any individual or organization, but only by Free, Self Governing, &ldquo;Undivided&rdquo; &ldquo;Human&rdquo; Society. Lifemaker is just a good name to describe the feeling and purpose of what this movement is about. There can be more names as well, but the object is this movement itself.</p>

<h2 id="the-universal-human-problem">The universal human problem</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Our society and most of its individuals and families are not living freely, fearlessly, happily, harmoniously or mutually fulfilled, at least not all the time, if not most of the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are suffering from never ending strife, misunderstanding, miscommunication, division, conflict and misery at all scopes of human existence - within Self, families, neighborhoods, regions, humankind and with rest of Nature.</p>

<p>Till date humankind has not been able to establish a self sustaining, familial and social order and environment, such that it fosters continuity of true liberation, happiness and fulfillment within each individual, family and all its relationships - from physical family, to village, to neighborhood, region, state, to the World Family.</p>

<h2 id="the-universal-human-need">The universal human need</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Every human wants to feel fulfillment, happiness, peace, harmony <em>within its Self and with rest of the World, all the time</em>. <em>No matter what</em> the belief is, situation is, expectation is or decision is, every human is ultimately seeking the same in every &ldquo;here and now&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-opportunity-the-challenge">The opportunity, the challenge</h2>

<ul>
<li>To unite and live harmoniously, compassionately and prosperously as ONE World Family, as per the natural laws of Existence and the way we are actually, as human beings.</li>
<li>To establish and sustain justful and resolved family as the unit of undivided society. To ensure each human family lives justfully with resolution for their material and conscious needs and responsibilities, lives happily and prosperously, in harmony with rest of human family &amp; nature.</li>
<li>To collectively and consensually establish, upkeep and live by a timeless tradition of self governance (Swarajya) which works in a fractal way of self governance from bottom up - from family, to village, to state to world family, based on Universal understanding of Self as human, Existence as Co-existence, and universal human values.</li>
<li>To understand &amp; live by a social working model which is naturally acceptable to every human alike, is <em>guaranteed to satisfy</em> all human needs &amp; aspirations over all time to come (from material to consciuous, individual to physical family to neighborhood to world family, human to nature) and helps humanity realise and demonstrate the full potential of being human.</li>
<li>To establish and maintain family and grassroots based tradition of happy, prosperous, peaceful and harmonious self governance, covering broadly the aspects of human values development education (or Life education) and research, health and nutrition, ecology friendly production and services, local circular exchange and economy, justice (everyone&rsquo;s fulfillment) and celebration, nurture of nature and conservation &amp; right utilization of resources.<br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-proposed-solution-and-approach">The proposed solution and approach</h2>

<p>In order to align together our only refuge is to understand universal reality and come together with that perspective to live together as &ldquo;humans&rdquo;. For this we need a parallel program for educational and societal reform. Here are the key points of the current proposed approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Put forward the first draft of vision, values, manifesto, policies and constitution for the undivided human society. This shall forever stay open to evolution as per increased universal understanding and consensus. The first version is expected to be put online, and applied in pilot villages, in 2020.</li>
</ul>

<p>&ndash; The working draft of the aims and objectives, as written in 2018, can be found <a href="./https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tt9Tcn0pMVg1Q-GfvFX9ll8xko-5SuCoumR2UJG-LAw">here</a></p>

<p>&ndash; The working draft of charter of values, drafted in November 2017, can be found <a href="./values">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick up few inspired families in pilot villages. Establish and prove the model through them. Setup the foundation nurseries of Undivided Human Society on ground. (First pilot village is Saalig, located in Tehsil Dharamsala, Dist. Kangra, India)</li>
<li>Incubate and establish councils from the pilot villages to the world level. Collaborate between these teams to ensure success of local pilots.</li>
<li>Develop and set up online infrastructure to help in relevant aspects of the social program for Self Governance. For ex. register as member individual, family, group from anywhere; study and understand from online content; discuss; network; collaborate; help, get help; local circular e-commerce; travel to member spaces and families for networking, experience &amp; learning etc.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./images/alice/impossible.jpg" alt="image This is impossible. {Only if you believe it is}" /></p>

<h2 id="what-s-happening-2019">What&rsquo;s happening 2019?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pilot in Village Saalig &amp; in Dharamsala town, Himachal Pradesh under cooperative society model.</li>
<li>Life education program has been kickstarted, for children and adults of the village.</li>
<li>Local production and consumption of food based products.</li>
<li>Meeting and collaborating as likeminded society members, active in the same direction. Engaging in discussions and documentation of

<ul>
<li>Aims, objectives, universal human values, policies, constitution</li>
<li>Working model with all five dimensions of education, health, production, exchange and justice<br /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Setting up of online discussion forum and universal education module</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="coming-together-with-a-shared-universal-perspective-is-our-only-refuge">Coming together with a shared, universal perspective is our only refuge</h3>

<p><em>We may have different viewpoints on nature of Self and reality, different skin color, occupations and opinions, but as humans we are all the same. Through honest objective and subjective inquiry humanity as society and each human is bound to understand and realise Truth in the same way, because we exist in the same Truth. Our sameness as humans, the onlyness of Truth (Existence in which we co-exist), honest self inquiry for Truth, and agreement on the way to live, is the (only) unifying ground, which will provide Life the absolute and permanent resolution it needs and seeks.</em></p>

<h2 id="call-to-the-tribe">Call to the tribe</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Every human is seeking happiness, mostly externally. Happiness can only be found when we are in sync with own true nature, and it reflects in fulfilment of our relationships with the world and with our own Self. The individuals are like small streams, which may or may not be able to make to the ocean alone. But together, our company of Truth can form a large river, which surely will reach the ocean of realised co-existential bliss; and there will be mutual wellbeing and happiness all along the way and for all our future generations to come on Earth.</p>
