<h5 id="do-you-suffer-do-you-feel-that-the-world-has-harmed-you-in-any-way-do-you-lose-your-calm">Do you suffer? Do you feel that the World has harmed you in any way? Do you lose your calm?</h5>

<p><em>Do you feel you, your life, relationships or the World can get better in any way? Do you wish to learn or understand something new? Do you have any dream to fulfill? Are you facing some challenge or question that seem to puzzle you? Do you find yourself wishing for peace of Mind at times? Are there any duties or desires that you wish to fulfill? Do you derive joy in serving others, and wonder how you can serve better?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reaching out to us for clarity, healing and empowerment may be the best thing you do</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter what is your area of concern, we may be able to channelise help for you. Read more about the Lifeline service <a href="./lifeline">here</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-lifemaker">What is LifeMaker?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A global family of mutual empowerment, glued by the spirit of Oneness - <strong>All is One. One is All.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lifemaker is a network of supreme knowledge and selfless action. We live in love, peace, open mindedness, acceptance and mutual support. We share and a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0" target="_blank">common aspiration of the way of living</a>. We are a non-commercial, self-sustainable, by people and for people movement, <em>without any hidden agenda, desire to control or greed</em>, to empower each other (in all ways possible), in order to</p>

<ul>
<li>allow your <a href="./whoami">True Nature</a> to take over the ignorant, limited and suffering ego-sense</li>
<li>dissolve the (illusive) borders that make one feel separate from the other</li>
<li>be established in (Real and Eternal) bliss, spontaneity and peace <em>within</em></li>
<li>fulfill the Heart&rsquo;s calling (or inner voice) in all aspects of life</li>
<li>live compassionately, responsibly and justfully <em>with each other and all Life</em></li>
<li>co-create and share abundance with all Life</li>
</ul>

<p>We are here to empower those who wish to bring meaning, happiness and growth in their lives or in lives of others. Alone, as we all are in today&rsquo;s individualistic world, we are weak. Together, i.e. truly together as ONE, as a global family of Love and Light, well connected and organised, we can create a shared ecosystem and energy field, which will help each one of us tap into our infinite potential and bliss, with much greater ease. Only our sense of separation from the Existence makes us feel limited, lonely and negative. Bliss, spontaneity and love is our true nature, only shrouded by our viel of ignorance. Heaven is within us. Let us do the unvieling together!</p>

<h2 id="way-of-life">Way of Life</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The community of Lifemaker shares a common <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0" target="_blank">charter of the Way of Life</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a shared aspiration of an attitude deemed fit for living a fulfilled and harmonious life – individually and socially. The charter is maintained by the Lifemaker community. It will forever be evolving and improving, in an open manner, so that the way of life transends time, space and culture. If you are considering joining us, please make an effort to review the charter. Let us know how it resonates with you, how can it be improved etc.</p>

<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I am that (indivisible, unborn, undying, formless, limitless, eternal Self, present equally, everywhere)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ego-sense which feels a separate I from rest of the Existence, is an illusion. The real, spontaneous Self is without the other, or separation.</p>

<h4 id="all-is-one-one-is-all">All is ONE. ONE is All.</h4>

<p>Like gold exists as the self same in all jewels (forms), but the jewels have no existence without the Gold, I exist as the unchanging same in <em>all that is</em>, but all that is can not exist without Me. Because I am eternal and unchanging, the source of everything, which exists also in deep sleep as well in dreams - only I am real. The mind, ego, body and World have a lifespan, and are forever changing. They come from Me and go back into Me. Hence how can they be called real?</p>

<p>The same teaching is passed by all relegions, sages and prophets in different words suited for their times.</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism" target="_blank">Non-dualism across all historical relegions and spiritual movements</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Read more about the philosophy of non-duality <a href="./philosophy">here</a>, or just search on internet yourself to see how every relegion and prohet spoke the same in different words.*</p>

<p><em>If we truly realised this One Absolute Truth as an experiential reality, we would not be fighting, because we will all be aligned at the source, the center, the dot. There will be peace, prosperity and happiness for humanity. Every Sage, Saint or Prophet lovingly wished to unify humanity on the same principal.</em></p>

<h2 id="three-kinds-of-lifemaker-members">Three kinds of Lifemaker members</h2>

<h4 id="elders-or-budhdhas">Elders (or Budhdhas)</h4>

<p>By elders we mean the Self realised souls, who shine forth with unblemished illumination of the Revelation. Their consciouness and experience is that of Oneness, like Buddha. Lifemaker has the blessing to have some truly Wise – Realised and Selfless souls, living in infinitude, here to guide and advice us as senior family members. Some of our current elders are – Ranganathan Chari from Kodaikanal, Anish Joel from Dharamsala, Pran Krsna Baba, Nimay Nitai and others from Radhakund and Vrindavana, Swamiji Harish Karun from Tang, Dharamsala and some unnamed ones. They are growing in number as our tribe connections grow.</p>

<h4 id="seekers-or-seeders">Seekers (or seeders)</h4>

<p>All Lifemakers, except the elders, are seekers. They are seeking the source of ultimate happiness and abundance in life.
You can join us as a seeker of the Self, or one who is simply looking to improve their life. You do not have to claim to be an expert in any domain. The day you feel ready to share something with the world as an expert, we will support you in the transition. Our current seeders are helping us by donating funds, spreading the word, ideation and design and technology for our upcoming apps.</p>

<h4 id="experts">Experts</h4>

<p>As Lifemakers, we wish to be available to humanity to help them do well in any aspect of existence. From the dot (the Self) to the circle (life activities). Everyone has something to share. If you are good at something, anything, and wish to share the same for others&rsquo; benefit, please get in touch with us. Read more about the skills we currently have in the <a href="./lifeline">Lifeline section</a> But really, we are happy to add your unique skill to the list. It could be making paper toys to rockets that go to Mars. Anything that you are good at, and is useful for someone to learn.</p>
