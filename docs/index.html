<h2 id="am-i-truly-happy-and-fulfilled">Am I truly happy and fulfilled?</h2>

<p>Is happiness my spontaneous nature? If not, is it my desire? If yes, then why am I not happy all the time? Do I do actions as a being of happiness or do I do actions, in order to be happy? Do external agents or conditions give me happiness or is this intrinsic? <em>Who am I</em>, really, (the One who is here right now)? Is there a purpose or grander scheme of things in being here and experiencing <em>all this</em>, in this form? Is there even a need to know the grander scheme? Or is it simply enough, to be My spontaneous, natural and happy Self? Is the happiness of My family, community, humanity, Co-existence not My happiness? Can we truly prosper in silos, as it is today? <strong>How can We be happy together?</strong> Should something change, or <em>improve</em>? If yes, then what is it? Is it within, without or both? Do I, as in this human form, with this family and community, and do We, as humanity, have the possibility, of a complete, mutually fulfilling, and justful approach, towards ensuring nutrition, health, safety, love, abundance, happiness, meaningful growth and Self-realisation for all families like mine? Can we live in symbiosis with Nature, as equals with all animal and plant species? Are there others asking these same questions? Are there some who have answers? Are there some who are committed to, and or indeed <em>actually</em>, living this way?</p>

<p><em>Are you facing questions or challenges - material to mind to spiritual, or from personal to family to social? Do you need any kind of help or insight? Or do you wish to share an insight?</em></p>

<h2 id="a-friendly-lifeline-is-here-for-you">A friendly Lifeline is here for you</h2>

</blockquote>

We are an of people and for people family, its member units giving support to each other on a collective journey of Infinity on Earth, as One Unit. We wish to setup a tradition of Enlightened and Prosperous social living, which will include anyone with any background, who wishes for unconditional happiness as a continuous state.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to see some of our members call out to our Tribe at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="our-goals">Our goals</h2>

<p>The aim of LifeMaker is to foster a global and local collaboration for nutrition, health, abundance, love, happiness, trust, symbiosis, self-growth and self-realisation in every family. By connecting the global tribe as families of truth seekers and change makers, we aim to create the conditions for a <em>new planetary culture of Enlightened consciousness, continuous happiness and justfulness in shared abundance</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mutually fulfilled, happy and growing families, joined together as One Universal Family</li>
<li>To discover the nature of Self and live justfully with all relationships in co-existence</li>
<li>To conserve and use resources wisely</li>
<li>To be locally sustainable clusters of families living <em>in symbiosis with</em> each other and local Nature</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adopt a <em>complete solution</em> covering (every) family&rsquo;s material, mental and spiritual needs</li>
<li>Adopting a family based approach for existential and co-existential <a href="./model">education</a> and <a href="./values">value based co-living</a>

<ul>
<li>A union of at least two people with a common goal to live life together meanigfully, is being called a family</li>
<li>Everyone is part of some family or other, whether by blood, friendship or Spirit.</li>
<li>Those who find themselves completely isolated without anyone, are welcome to join any family from our Universal family</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Helping each other <em>in every meaningful way possible</em></li>
<li>A mutual understanding of co-ownership, conservation and right utilisation of any resources</li>
<li>Living in villages and communities in symbiosis with nature

<ul>
<li>If city life is needed for some families, they can also live in mutual symbiosis in cities</li>
<li>Yet those families must come and stay with village based families for at least some time every now and then</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Being locally and mutually sustainable

<ul>
<li>Natural farming with local sharing</li>
<li>Being complementary and cooperative to the greatest extent possible</li>
<li>Least dependence on imported goods or skills</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Equally accessible information and learning resources to all</li>
<li>Children of all families are children of the Integral Family</li>
<li>Wellbeing of every member is wellbeing of the Integral Family</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="philosophy-who-am-i">Philosophy: Who am I?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I am</strong> (Existence, indivisible, integral, unborn, undying, formless, limitless, timeless, eternal Self, forever same, omnipresent, transcendental). <strong>I am (Existence), with everyone (Co-existence).</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every one, has the same nature of Self within, because it is our True nature. This revelation is equally accessible to everyone, and we experience it in moments as pure Happiness or Love. Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Prophet Mohammed, Krishna, Nanak, Rumi, Osho, Krishnamurthy, Ramana Maharishi and millions of others throughout our history have experienced and shared this with us for our benefit, <em>in different ways</em>. But we don&rsquo;t see people really happy, despite the material &ldquo;development&rdquo; in last century. Why doesn&rsquo;t the wise teachings of our ancestors work for us today? What is lacking? We want to find and fill that lacking. Everyone can be a Master and Knower, and their knowing be beautifully manifested in their relationships, family and work. This is what we, as modern humans, wish for present and future Humanity.</p>

<p>You can read more about the philosophy of non-duality and duality and its backing, by all major relegions, prophets, masters and philosophers <a href="./philosophy">here</a></p>
