      <description>The human problem  Our society and most of its individuals and families are not living freely, fearlessly, happily, harmoniously or mutually fulfilled, at least not all the time, if not most of the time.
 We are suffering from never ending strife, misunderstanding, miscommunication, division, conflict and misery at all scopes of human existence - within Self, families, neighborhoods, regions, humankind and with rest of Nature.
Till date humankind has not been able to establish a self sustaining, familial and social order and environment, such that it fosters continuity of true liberation, happiness and fulfillment within each individual, family and all its relationships - from physical family, to village, to neighborhood, region, state, to the World Family.</description>

      <description>A relationship may or may not be related to the body, but it is accepted and fulfilled by the two minds.
 What is family? By using the word family, we are meaning - a group where every member trusts to find happiness in each other&amp;rsquo;s company.
A family is a group of people living together with assurance of mutual protection, fulfillment and love. It is the first place for a human to experience fulfilling relationships which nurture the body and self.</description>

      <description>Past: 20th century AD and before Not so bad Humans were still learning and adapting to nature  More physical work to do. Less comfortable physical existence in terms of housing, clothing, heating, energy, health facility, food production etc. Higher mortality risk. Attack from animals. Climate. Weather. Diseases. Not such a developed surgery and medical system in west. But there was Ayurveda and chi gung in East. Uncleanliness and lack of hygene  The ugly Problems faced by humans between humans  Communalism and division between human to human Attack from each other - loot, crimes and war Ruled by power and fear - State, Religion Superstition also ruled the human mind  The good The good in the past  For every human the world was full of wonders to be discovered!</description>
