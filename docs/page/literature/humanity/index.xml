      <description>Past: 20th century AD and before Not so bad Humans still learning and adapting to nature  More physical work to do. Less comfortable physical existence in terms of housing, clothing, heating, energy, health facility, food production etc. Higher mortality risk. Attack from animals. Climate. Weather. Diseases. Not such a developed surgery and medical system in west. But there was Ayurveda and chi gung in East. Uncleanliness and hygene  The ugly Problems faced by humans between humans  Communalism and division between human to human Attack from each other - loot, crimes and war Ruled by power and fear - State, Religion  The good The good in the past  For every human the world was full of wonders to be discovered!</description>
