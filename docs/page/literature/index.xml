      <title>Existence Itself Is Coexistence</title>

      <description>What is existence? Existence is all-that-is. Existence itself is co-existence. Existence is inseparable, indivisible, absolute. Existence itself is truth, knowledge, reality, actuality.
Existence is one and only. There is no &amp;lsquo;peer’ or other outside existence. There is no &amp;lsquo;creator&amp;rsquo; outside of existence for where would the creator exist if not inside existence?
Existence itself is God. Existence is all there is to know. Existence is the total object of knowing.</description>

      <description>What is love? Is attachment to someone love? Is being with someone to fill a gap within love? Is love conditional? We often say - “I love chicken or I love the color of your hair!”. Is that love? What is love?
If you have ever loved someone and don’t feel love today, did you ever love? If you expect to get love as a condition to give love, is it love that you are giving?</description>

      <description>Happiness is our true nature. Every Human wants to be happy. All prophets, relegions and philosophers have spoken the same truth in different ways. And yet Humanity has evaded the light of happiness somehow. Most of us are caught in a blind rush, desiring happiness from actions or objects but don&amp;rsquo;t know answers to the what, why and how with stability and clarity. We have not been told so far that for happiness to happen in continuity for any family it needs mental resolution, material abundance, mutual trust/confidence and all-round fulfillment in relationships.</description>

      <title>Family education</title>

      <description>We believe family education is the way to educate our selves, and bring forth a new System and Order. By family, we mean at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment. Family is the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living. An integrated, enlightened and healthy family is the basic unit for an integrated, enlightened and healthy human society.</description>
