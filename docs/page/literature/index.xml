      <description>A Life is a conscious experiencer and doer in existence You and I are units of Life each. So is every human and animal on Earth which has a brain, nervous system, at least two senses and can learn and evolve within one lifetime.
Animals don&amp;rsquo;t and generally can&amp;rsquo;t think about the nature of Self but humans can and they do. A human has full faculty to grasp the knowledge of Self and Existence and make good use of it.</description>
