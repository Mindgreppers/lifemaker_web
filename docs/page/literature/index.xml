      <description>Natural acceptance arises from the innateness of the Self Assumptions and thoughts may or may not be in line with the innateness of the Self, especially if the deeper self is unused. And what is innateness of the Self? Pursuit of harmony!  The deeper part inside us is inline with innateness and just knows (the Truth, the right, the harmonious).
 This deeper part always knows the purpose or what to be, innateness, what to do as a human being.</description>

      <description>Space or Void or Shoony (Hindi)  Space is infinite energy in eternal equilibrium Because it is in permanent equilibrium, it is static; i.e. has no activity of its own.  It is transparent (does not affect any thing), omnipresent (present everywhere, even where there is no unit of Nature) and transcendental (is required for the units of Nature to coexist) Space is the (fundamental) field of which all fields, whether material or conscious, are part.</description>

      <description>My dear curious one
I have been waiting for you to arrive at this page. My name is Ayush and for the time being, I am the sole author of the essays listed below, touching upon the essence of Life, Existence and undivided, happy and prosperous Human Society. I have been through (a still ongoing) cosmic and very human journey of reunion with the source and in my inquisitive explorations have found universally acceptable answers (resolution) to some important questions pertaining to human existence on Earth.</description>

      <description>The answer can be given at two levels A. I am Existence itself. B. I am a conscious unit in Existence, here on Earth as a human. A. As Existence itself  I am all-that-is. I am the only thing that exists (also called Truth). I am indivisible. All my parts are interrelated, interconnected, interdependent. I am experiencing myself through infinite conscious units. I am expressing myself as infinite material and conscious units.</description>
