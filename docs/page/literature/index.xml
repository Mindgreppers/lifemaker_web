      <description>Every Life goes through a process of evolution culminating in full evolution The moment a Life comes into existence it gets free from the physical forces of Existence. And it becomes bound to the force of desire. It starts to follow its desires for self fulfillment. One desire subsides. Another arises. Old desires arise again. Like waves on a sea shore, desires keep coming. Life runs here and there trying to experience every desire.</description>

      <description>Life - a conscious unit of energy like you, me and the one in ant form too - is headed on a journey of evolution. Life is like a river which is meant to fully realise its source, its destination, its Self and the oneness of all. Life is on a journey to realise how it is an inseparable part of all-that-is.
 Since its inception this unit goes through a journey of evolution where its constituent parts find a greater alignment between them as &amp;ldquo;the river progresses&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Life: the conscious seer and experiencer of existence  The real you and real me must be made of the same fabric from which entire existence is made - energy. Hence, we are but a-unit-of-energy which has become conscious of its presence in existence and is experiencing, learning and interacting with the existence consciously.
 There are three kinds of truth sets that exist in this regard in humanity.</description>
