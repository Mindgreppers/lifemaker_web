      <description>Happiness is our true nature. Every Human wants to be happy. All prophets, relegions and philosophers have spoken the same truth in different ways. And yet Humanity has evaded the light of happiness somehow. Most of us are caught in a blind rush, desiring happiness from actions or objects but don&amp;rsquo;t know answers to the what, why and how with stability and clarity. We have not been told so far that for happiness to happen in continuity for any family it needs mental resolution, material abundance, mutual trust/confidence and all-round fulfillment in relationships.</description>

      <description>This is the founding ground for human union To agree on same values of Life is the stepping stone to coming together for a grand party on Earth as one couple, family, team or undivided human society for justful, truthful &amp;amp; successful co-existence as humans.
Here we identified and enlisted some 30 values which are seen in enlightened Human Living. The explanation of every value may be done in so many ways and words, yet the essence of each value is to be realised by the heart and understood by the mind.</description>
