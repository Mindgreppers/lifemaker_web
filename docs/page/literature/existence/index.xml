      <title>Existence Itself Is Coexistence</title>

      <description>Existence is all-that-is. All-that-is is existence. All is but one and only. Existence is all-that-is. Existence itself is co-existence. Existence is inseparable, indivisible, absolute. Existence itself is truth, knowledge, reality, actuality.
There is no &amp;lsquo;peer’ or other outside existence. There is no &amp;lsquo;creator&amp;rsquo; outside of existence for where would the creator exist if not inside existence? If there would be more existences, in which existence would they exist together? Hence existence must be one and only.</description>

      <description>What is love? Is attachment to someone love? Is being with someone to fill a gap within love? Is love conditional? We often say - “I love chicken or I love the color of your hair!”. Is that love? What is love?
If you have ever loved someone and don’t feel love today, did you ever love? If you expect to get love as a condition to give love, is it love that you are giving?</description>
