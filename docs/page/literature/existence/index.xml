      <title>Existence Itself Is Coexistence</title>

      <description>Existence is all that is. All that is co-existing together is Existence. All is but one and only. Existence is inseparable, indivisible, absolute. Truth, knowledge, reality, actuality are different words meaning the same as Existence - all that is.
There is no &amp;lsquo;peer’ or other outside all that is (Existence). Can there be something left outside all that is?. There is no &amp;lsquo;creator&amp;rsquo; outside of Existence for where would the creator exist if not inside Existence?</description>

      <description>What is love? Is attachment to someone love? Is being with someone to fill a gap within love? Is love conditional? We often say - “I love chicken or I love the color of your hair!”. Is that love? What is love?
If you have ever loved someone and don’t feel love today, did you ever love? If you expect to get love as a condition to give love, is it love that you are giving?</description>
