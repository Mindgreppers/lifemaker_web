<p>We can help.</p>

<p>As an unconditional gift to the world, our Lifemaker coaches offer preliminary life advice and support to anyone from all across the world, for free. For detailed advice, we will request you to <em>donate as you can</em>, because we need to self-sustain.</p>

<p>Reach out to us on Watsapp, email, or a message on Facebook. Our online forum will be live soon. We support Hindi, English, Italian, Punjabi, Gaddi languages as of now. Contact details are on the left of this page.</p>

<p>After an initial conversation and understanding, we will put you in touch with the relevant experts, life coaches, benefactors or guides, who will do their best to help you with your particular query.</p>

<h4 id="our-areas-of-interest">Our areas of interest</h4>

<p>Between us we have expertise in a wide range of areas. The area that we focus is mainly self-realisation, self-assessment and self-improvement, as individuals or families.  But our interests are directed not only inwards, to the self, but also outwards, to the world. We believe in the ideal of a complete, multi-skilled, mind/body integrated human. Many of our members are experts in fitness and nutrition, relationship management, leadership, life and career, entrepreneurship, community building, low budget global travel, events, holistic education, skill-based empowerment, sustainability, permaculture and gardening, technology, animal welfare, global politics and economics.</p>

<p>If we have missed something out in which you may need or offer help, please get in touch with us nonetheless, and let’s see what we can come up with together.</p>

<h4 id="explore-answers-with-us">Explore answers with us</h4>

<p><em>You can ask us any question you face. For example:</em></p>

<p>How can I be at true peace and find bliss within? How can I be free from confusion, negative thoughts and emotions? How can my relationships be improved? How can I be healthy - in body, mind and spirit? How can I improve myself? How can I be unconditionally happy? How can I find love? How can I better achieve my goals or fulfill my duties? Which profession should I choose? How can I be a good leader? What can I learn from my or our mistakes? How can I make the world a better place?</p>

<p><em>We are happy to be useful in any way, not just limited to the areas mentioned above. Our community has diverse technical, creative, material and abstract skills. So you’re welcome to ask us just about anything!</em></p>

<h2 id="our-team">Our team</h2>

<p>All of our members are personally known and vetted before being included as Lifemakers experts. We’ll make sure to get you connected with the best possible fit for your need so that the advice you get comes from a real expert in that field. Of course you can always discuss and even disagree with our judgment: nobody knows you better then yourself, and yours is the final call and responsibility for all your actions. You can see us as friends lending you an ear and giving you the best advice we got: our only motive is to see you grow as a soul and act with greater clarity, peace and resolve.</p>

<p>Since this is a community based initiative, and still in growing stage, allow us some time to respond. You will surely hear back from us.</p>

<h2 id="diving-deep">Diving deep</h2>

<p>Email or phone can do only a little. While through our Lifeline service we’ll still try to do the best for you, if you want to dive deep it’s best to come and visit meet our members, in Dharamsala, H.P., India – our current heardquarters, or other places in the world. We will let you know the closest members you can visit.</p>
