<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<h4 id="what-is-lifemaker">What is LifeMaker?</h4>

<p>LifeMaker is a movement or family or community, of people, by people and for people,</p>

<ul>
<li>to be fulfilled, happy and growing, on a moment to moment basis.</li>
<li>to discover the non-dual nature of Self and start abiding therein</li>
<li>to co-create a new world of peace, love, unity and abundance.</li>
<li>to simplify the puzzle called life into a spontaneous expression of the Self</li>
</ul>

<p>We are here to empower those who wish to bring meaning and happiness in their lives or in lives of others. Alone, as we all are in today&rsquo;s individualistic world, we are weak. Together, i.e. truly together, and well organised, as a global family of Love and Light, we are infinitely powerful and efficient. Only our sense of separation from the Existence makes us feel lonely and negative. Heaven is right here on Earth. Let us do the unvieling.</p>

<h1 id="is-lifemaker-community-s-philosophy-of-oneness-a-new-revelation">Is Lifemaker community&rsquo;s philosophy of Oneness a new revelation?</h1>

<p>Not at all. It is backed by direct experience of not just Lifemaker members, but also innumerable human ancestors from all across the world, since thousands of years, even before relegions came into being. The same knowledge has been put in different words or symbols by all messengers, shamans, Sages or relegions. Lifemaker represents the same  knowledge, presented in a way modern humanity can rationally and in feeling, related to.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-aim-of-lifemaker">What is the aim of LifeMaker?</h4>

<p>The aim of LifeMaker is to foster self-growth, love and happiness in everyone’s life. By connecting the global tribe of truth seekers and change makers, we aim to create the conditions for a new planetary culture of peace, Singular consciousness and abundance.</p>

<h4 id="who-are-the-people-involved-in-this-project">Who are the people involved in this project?</h4>

<p>There are many people who’ve helped/inspired the LifeMaker project and have given an invaluable contribution to its inception. Currently we are two main contributors, joined by many volunteers and supporters in the role of 4 elders or Wise ones, 5 developers, couple of designers and around 150 seeders. Our base countries are India and Italy. You can see full list of team <a href="../team">here</a></p>

<h2 id="the-community">The Community</h2>

<p>You are welcome to come and stay with us. Reach out to us through contact information on home page and we’ll help you sort out the travel arrangements.</p>

<h4 id="is-there-a-primary-hub-to-get-introduced-to-lifemaker-community-and-way-of-life">Is there a primary hub to get introduced to Lifemaker community and way of Life?</h4>

<p>The ground Zero for Lifemaker is in the lap of Himalayas at Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. It is an Ashram run by Swamiji Harish Karun, one of our elders and an enlightened soul. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5424351357#map=16/32.1655/76.4007" target="_blank">Here</a> is the location on Open Street Map.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-participate-in-lifemaker-events">How do I participate in LifeMaker events?</h4>

<h4 id="are-the-events-free">Are the events free?</h4>

<p>The cost of our events, like all of Lifemaker activities, are covered by contribution through members. If someone has a financial limitation, they can approach us and request a free or subsidised entry, in return for volunteer work for the event.</p>

<p>The Network
What are the hubs/spaces connected to LifeMaker?
These are hubs and community spaces around the world that share the LifeMaker values and support the project in some way. We will start listing them soon.</p>

<p>How do I find a LifeMaker hub/space near my home?
The current list of hubs/spaces in line with our vision and ethos, is visible <a href="../hubs">here</a>.
On the page you’ll find contact details for each hub/space. Please contact them and ask for availability.</p>

<p>How do I connect my hub/space with LifeMaker?
You can connect your hub/space to the LifeMaker network by agreeing to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AtEj2GhpBe9REYUvQ999nMklHZq1RohGEOhM0OhqQ0" target="_blank">Way of Living charter</a> and sending an application email to the Core team.</p>

<p>The Charter
What is the Way of Living?
The Way of Living is an aspirational charter which all LifeMaker subscribe to and is aimed to bring the best out of everyone, for everyone’s benefit.</p>

<p>Do I have to agree with the Way of Living?
The Way of Living is an aspirational charter and must not be taken as a compulsion, because in compulsion there is no Freedom - which is one of our aspirations. It is intended as a set of shared guidelines to keep as an ethical compass in our lives.</p>

<p>How can I follow the Way of Living in my life?
The intention will already make wonders. Then of course is up to everyone to work on themselves and put in the daily effort to become the best you can possibly be.
We all have some flaws and we all make mistakes and that’s when you’ll find in the LifeMaker community all the support and guidance you’ll need to get back on track.</p>

<p>How can I contribute to the Way of Living?
The Way of Living is an open document and will evolve as our community evolves.  You can contribute by joining the related thread on the forum, and send us your poetry/artwork.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-we-gain-members">How do we gain members?</h4>

<p>All of our members are personally known and vetted before being included as expert Lifemakers. We ensure so that you get connected with a right fit for your need and who will sincerely give you the advice he knows to work from his experience and knowledge. If needed to connect you to someone else, he or she will happily do that too! Our only motive is to see you grow as a soul and act with greater clarity, peace and resolve.</p>

<p>Since this is a community based initiative, and still in growing stage, allow us up to 24 hours to respond. You will surely hear from us.</p>
