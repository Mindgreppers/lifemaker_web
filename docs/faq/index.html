<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<h4 id="who-are-the-people-involved-in-this-project">Who are the people involved in this project?</h4>

<p>There are many people who’ve helped/inspired the LifeMaker project and have given an invaluable contribution to its inception. We are joined by a bunch of elders, volunteers and supporters in different roles. We are getting special help from <a href="http://saadhosangha.org" target="_blank">Saadho</a> and <a href="madhyasth-darshan.info" target="_blank">Enlightened Family Project</a> teams.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-join">Can I join?</h4>

<p>Everyone is welcome to join. Our tribe welcomes people from any walk of life. Just that we wish you join with your family or community, with whom you live on an intimate basis, so that we are more effective.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-get-in-touch">How to get in touch?</h4>

<p>You can join our low traffic <a href="https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/lifemaker" target="_blank">mailing list</a>, follow us on <a href="https://facebook.com/lifemaker-app" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, join our upcoming <a href="../forum">forum</a> or come and meet us in person at our <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5424351357#map=19/32.19787/76.36606" target="_blank">community space</a> in the Himalayas or at one of our events (Check the calendar!) We keep making announcements on our social channels and mailing list about latest and greatest updates.</p>

<h2 id="the-community">The Community</h2>

<h4 id="does-lifemaker-have-a-physical-space">Does LifeMaker have a physical space?</h4>

<p>Our homes and hubs are your space. Our first hub is in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India. We are distributed across India and Italy mostly, for now.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-we-gain-members">How do we gain members?</h4>

<p>It will mostly mean a visit to one of our families or attending our workshops and retreats. Once we arrive at a common understanding, a mutual call happens.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-visit-join-the-community">How do I visit/join the community?</h4>

<p>You are welcome to come and stay with us. Reach out to us through contact information on home page and we’ll help you sort out the travel arrangements.</p>

<h4 id="is-there-a-primary-hub-to-get-introduced-to-lifemaker-community-and-way-of-life">Is there a primary hub to get introduced to Lifemaker community and way of Life?</h4>

<p>The ground Zero for Lifemaker is in the lap of Himalayas at Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, India.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-participate-in-lifemaker-events">How do I participate in LifeMaker events?</h4>

<p>You can check out our event calendar and see if there’s an event happening near your home. Otherwise, you might ask us to add a date.</p>

<h4 id="are-the-events-free">Are the events free?</h4>

<p>The cost of our events, like all of Lifemaker activities, are covered by contribution through members. If someone has a financial limitation, they can approach us and request a free or subsidised entry, in return for volunteer work for the event.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-connect-my-family-with-lifemaker">How do I connect my family with LifeMaker?</h4>

<p>You can connect your hub/space/family to the LifeMaker network by spending at least 7 days with us, in an open frame to understand and evolve, what Lifemaker</p>

<h2 id="the-charter">The Charter</h2>

<h4 id="what-is-the-way-of-living">What is the Way of Living?</h4>

<p>The Way of Living is an aspirational charter of Universal values, which all LifeMaker subscribe to and is aimed to bring the best out of everyone, for everyone’s benefit.</p>

<h4 id="do-i-have-to-agree-with-the-way-of-living">Do I have to agree with the Way of Living?</h4>

<p>The Way of Living is an aspirational charter and must not be taken as a compulsion, because in compulsion there is no Freedom - which is one of our aspirations. It is intended as a set of shared guidelines to keep as an ethical compass in our lives.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-i-follow-the-way-of-living-in-my-life">How can I follow the Way of Living in my life?</h4>

<p>The intention will already make wonders. We all need to work on ourselves, in a family based approach, and put in the daily effort to become the best we can possibly be. We have a family based education approach.
We all have some flaws. We all make mistakes and that’s when you’ll find in the LifeMaker community, all the support and guidance you’ll need to get back on track.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-i-contribute-to-the-way-of-living">How can I contribute to the Way of Living?</h4>

<p>The Way of Living is an open document and will evolve as our community evolves.  You can contribute by contacting us with your suggestions and inputs.</p>
