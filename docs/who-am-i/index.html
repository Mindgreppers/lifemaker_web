<h2 id="i-am-eternal-infinite-omnipresent-omnipotent-i-am-inseparable-indivisible-all-that-is-i-am-existence">I am eternal, infinite, omnipresent, omnipotent. I am inseparable, indivisible &amp; all-that-is. I am Existence.</h2>

<h4 id="i-am-eternal-existence-experiencing-itself-as-life-right-here-right-now">I am eternal Existence experiencing itself as Life, right here right now</h4>

<p><strong><em>As Life</em></strong> the little me is consciously experiencing the BIG ME (Existence itself). Existence is the FUNDAMENTAL ME. I am present here in the human form as a unique expression of the BIG ME.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;I&rdquo; I sense, feel and live as is a Life. Life is what senses, feels and lives as the I. <em>Life is the phenomenon called I</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You and I are units of Life each. So is every human and animal on Earth which has a brain, nervous system, at least two senses and can learn and evolve within one lifetime. It is also possible that Life exists in infinite forms in other realms which are not as densely physical and bio-organic as Earth. Here we will focus on Earth and on our existence on Earth in human form <em>right here, right now</em>.</p>

<p>Animals don&rsquo;t and generally can&rsquo;t think about the nature of Life but humans can and they do. Life in human form has the full capability and can develop the ability to grasp the knowledge of Life and Existence and thereby live blissfully. This capability puts humans uniquely in the bucket of Knowledge Order on Earth and its Dharama is <em>to be, to grow, will to live and be happy, peaceful, content and blissful in co-existence</em>. Animals come in the animal order whose Dharma is <em>to be, to grow and will to live</em>. Then the lower two orders are Living Order like plants and microbes whose Dharma is <em>to be &amp; to grow</em>, and the Material Order whose Dharma is simply - <em>to be</em>. Every order includes and is built upon the lower order.</p>

<h2 id="so-technically-who-am-i">So technically who am I?</h2>

<p>There are three broad kind of truth sets that exist with regard to nature of Self in humanity on Earth.</p>

<ul>
<li>A. The oldest perspective has been that &ldquo;I am eternal &amp; indestructible. I change bodies like clothes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>B. The recently emerged materialistic perspective is &ldquo;I am from the body and hence mortal. I am the body or a byproduct (epiphenonmenon or emergence) of the body. My consciousness is a collective phenomenon emergent from collaboration of the trillions of unconscious cells that make my body, nervous system and brain.&rdquo;</li>
<li>C. This is also perhaps one of the oldest perspectives and is also a good place to be at for the curious inquisitor - &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. And perhaps, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether I am mortal or not.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-take-at-lifemaker-is-integration-of-all-perspectives-into-a-shared-perspective-agreeable-to-all">The take at Lifemaker is integration of all perspectives into a shared perspective agreeable to all</h2>

<p>Let us be honest with each other and admit that as humanity our perspective on this issue differs from one to another and this is a matter of personal faith and subjective experience. There is no objective way to prove one point or the other so that everyone is convinced of the same truth just like we are convinced that the Sun rises in the East. Speaking from perspective of entire humanity - &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know in unity the exact nature of Life &amp; especially whether Life (Self) is mortal or immortal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So given the divergence in perspectives on eternal nature of individual consciousness, what is the ultimate truth on which humanity can converge? We can say that whatever is that statement of truth, it <a href="../the-job-of-any-truth-set-is-to-be-useful">must be useful to us.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Usefulness means actions and experiences that are good, positive, constructive and beneficial not just for the Self but for entire co-existence. The measure of usefulness is lesser strife &amp; suffering and greater happiness, peace, ease, contentment and bliss with anyone and everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are seven billion people and <a href="../7-billion-people.-7-billion-truth-sets">seven billion truth sets.</a>. Which is the one statement of Truth that we can all, theists and atheists, literate or illiterate, rich or poor, religious or scientific minded, can agree on? What is that one perspective which is easiest and simplest for any human to accept and converge at?</p>

<h2 id="all-is-one-only-and-one-only-is-all-that-is-hence-whosoever-i-am-i-am-an-inseparable-part-and-expression-of-existence-itself-the-one-only-the-real-i-is-existence-itself">All is one &amp; only and one &amp; only is all that is. Hence whosoever I am, I am an inseparable part and expression of Existence itself - the one &amp; only. The real I is Existence itself!</h2>

<p>The fundamental truth on which every thinking human can agree is that <em>since we exist in Existence, the real you and real me must be made of the same fabric from which entire Existence is made. And that fabric is energy itself. Hence, each Life is but a-unit-of-energy, a part of Existence</em>, which has become conscious of itself and is experiencing, learning and interacting with the Existence (itself) consciously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The little I (Life) is an <em>inseparable constituent part</em> of the BIG I (Existence) which is <a href="../existence-itself-is-coexistence">all-that-is and one-&amp;-only</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="existence-contains-nature-both-material-and-conscious-life-is-a-conscious-unit-of-energy-present-in-nature">Existence contains nature both material and conscious. Life is a conscious unit of energy, present in nature.</h2>

<p>A unit of Life and also every atom or free energy is like a wave of energy swimming in the infinite sea of energy with other waves - all intricately connected and affecting all the rest - together, an inseparable ONE THING. Life exists intricately connected with the rest and with a body to experience the sea and express itself as part of the sea. The substance that constitutes any Life is the same substance that constitutes every particle, wave or Life in Existence. The same substance that is manifesting as &lsquo;others&rsquo; or &lsquo;rest of Existence&rsquo; whether material or conscious, is manifesting as &lsquo;me&rsquo;. All is one infinite sea of which every part is inseparably connected to all other parts. Every atom and every Life affects the rest of infinite Existence and is in turn affected by the entirety of the rest of it. Even science attests to this fact.</p>

<p><em>Given that we can agree on the fundamental truth of Oneness, there is another truth secondary from that on which it is not so hard to agree either.</em></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-human">What is a human?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A human is Life with a human body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter what is your belief system we can agree that broadly your existence as a human is of two parts.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The body</strong> which is operated by the mind, through which mind percieves the world and also acts in the world. On Earth, the body is made of bio-organic matter. A human body is made of trillions of unconscious cells which constitute the nervous system, brain and rest of the body, and together they act as a vessel for consciousness.</li>
<li><strong>Life</strong>, which has a soul and a mind

<ul>
<li><strong>The mind</strong> which desires, visualises, contemplats, thinks, compares, analyses, hopes, makes choices, tastes the outcomes, comprehends reality, learns and makes resolve. It senses through the body, percieves the body &amp; the world (through the body) and gives direction to the body to act in the world for living &amp; fulfillment of desires, hopes, intentions and resolution.</li>
<li><strong>The soul or the heart</strong>  is the seat of Consciousness in Self. It is the causal constituent part of Self and is the master of the mind (albeit passively in unevolved Life and actively in evolved Life). Soul is more fundamental to the mind. The soul is the manifested activity of unmanifest, primordial universal Consciousness. Soul has two functions.

<ul>
<li><strong>It <em>experiences</em></strong> the mind, body and the world. Soul is the screen on which all experience happens. This screen is blank in deep sleep and in dreaming or awake state, is filled with the experience of perception of the body/world by the mind, and the activity/state of the mind.<br /></li>
<li><strong>It _expresses</strong> or acts_ through the mind in order to experience. It is the causal source of all expression and activity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The mind and soul together (and inseparably) constitute Life. The body is the vehicle for Life to experience, learn and express (act) in Existence. A human is Life with a human body.</p>
