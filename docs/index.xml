      <description>Past: 20th century AD and before Not so bad Humans still learning and adapting to nature  More physical work to do. Less comfortable physical existence in terms of housing, clothing, heating, energy, health facility, food production etc. Higher mortality risk. Attack from animals. Climate. Weather. Diseases. Not such a developed surgery and medical system in west. But there was Ayurveda and chi gung in East. Uncleanliness and hygene  The ugly Problems faced by humans between humans  Communalism and division between human to human Attack from each other - loot, crimes and war Ruled by power and fear - State, Religion  The good The good in the past  For every human the world was full of wonders to be discovered!</description>

      <description>A lot happened in these 5 months. The Good We undertood a lot more The core team at Lifemaker understood a lot more about the right approach to start this project. We learned that people do not like to talk about things. They want action. People don&amp;rsquo;t want lectures. They want to know what they can do right away to solve a problem or challenge they face. So our whole approach change from education first perspective to taking both the working model and education in parallel.</description>

      <title>Only the whole of Self can realise the whole of Self</title>

      <description>A part can not realise the nature of the whole Just like 1 can never comprehend 2, the mind alone can not comprehend the nature of Self (or Life) because it is only a part of Life and not the whole of Life.
 There is something deeper than the mind - it is that part of the Self which is &amp;lsquo;experiencing&amp;rsquo; everything - the body, the world, the mind and even itself.</description>

      <description>I am undivided being. I am eternal, infinite, omnipotent. I am inseparable, indivisible &amp;amp; all-that-is. I am Existence. I am eternal Existence experiencing itself as Life. I experience and express, always in the here and now. As Life, as an individual unit of Existence, I am aware and consciously experiencing the BIG ME (Existence itself). I am present here in the human form as a unique expression of the REAL ME.</description>

      <title>The apriori or causal Truth</title>

      <guid>http://www.lifemaker.us/the-apriori-or-causal-truth/</guid>
      <description>That reality which exists independent of every conscious being or subjective perspective is being called the apriori Truth.
 As previously discussed there are as many truth sets as number of people, animals or conscious beings in existence. Now let me ask you to think about this - All conscious beings live in a reality which existed before we came into existence and will exist even if we did not exist.</description>

      <description>Every individual holds only to that truth set which they percieve to be useful.
 Every person has universal and irrevocable right to hold on to their truth set. They must surely find their truth as useful to them else why would they follow it? The day a person discovers some part of their truth set to be not useful for their happiness or growth, they look for a better or truer truth.</description>

      <description>Every person or animal holds their own truth set. Their truth set holds true in their world view. And all of these truth sets coexist in existence. Hence 7 billion people, 7 billion truth sets.
 Any truth set consists of two main components - faith and belief.
Faith is based on following Faith statements are followed based on reality assumed to hold true without self inquiry. Typically they are followed because someone held in high esteem by the person has spoken them.</description>

      <title>Existence Itself Is Coexistence</title>

      <guid>http://www.lifemaker.us/existence-itself-is-coexistence/</guid>
      <description>Existence is all that is. All that is co-existing together is Existence. All is but one and only. Existence is inseparable, indivisible, absolute. Truth, knowledge, reality, actuality are different words meaning the same as Existence - all that is.
There is no &amp;lsquo;peer’ or other outside all that is (Existence). Can there be something left outside all that is?. There is no &amp;lsquo;creator&amp;rsquo; outside of Existence for where would the creator exist if not inside Existence?</description>

      <description>What is love? Is attachment to someone love? Is being with someone to fill a gap within love? Is love conditional? We often say - “I love chicken or I love the color of your hair!”. Is that love? What is love?
If you have ever loved someone and don’t feel love today, did you ever love? If you expect to get love as a condition to give love, is it love that you are giving?</description>

      <description>Happiness is our true nature. Every Human wants to be happy. All prophets, relegions and philosophers have spoken the same truth in different ways. And yet Humanity has evaded the light of happiness somehow. Most of us are caught in a blind rush, desiring happiness from actions or objects but don&amp;rsquo;t know answers to the what, why and how with stability and clarity. We have not been told so far that for happiness to happen in continuity for any family it needs mental resolution, material abundance, mutual trust/confidence and all-round fulfillment in relationships.</description>

      <description>This is the founding ground for human union To agree on same values of Life is the stepping stone to coming together for a grand party on Earth as one couple, family, team or undivided human society for justful, truthful &amp;amp; successful co-existence as humans.
Here we identified and enlisted some 30 values which are seen in enlightened Human Living. The explanation of every value may be done in so many ways and words, yet the essence of each value is to be realised by the heart and understood by the mind.</description>

      <description>We believe family education is the way to educate our selves, and bring forth a new System and Order. By family, we mean at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment. Family is the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living. An integrated, enlightened and healthy family is the basic unit for an integrated, enlightened and healthy human society.</description>

      <description>Three kinds of Lifemaker members While we are talking of members as individuals here, we are in reality rcruiting families! Families are our favorite target audience, because in togetherness is the living proof of the individual&amp;rsquo;s realisation and happiness. And also, most of us feel most comfortable and at home, with our families which provide us the nurturing environment to grow.
Elders (or Budhdhas) By elders we mean the Self realised souls, who shine forth with unblemished illumination of the Revelation.</description>

      <description>Singularity - All is ONE. ONE is All. Like gold exists as the self same in all jewels (forms) and even without jewels, but the jewels have no existence without the Gold, what exists as the unchanging same in all that is, and also where there is none of that, is the Source of everything. Because that Source is eternal, omnipresent and unchanging, free from desires and ever fulfilled, it&amp;rsquo;s nature is happiness.</description>
