For this big task to be accomplished, we need not only hard work and mind share from many, but also material and resource support, including funds.
We need funds for these immediate goals

      <description>Many - sequence - arrangement - pattern - system - system and order
 When enough streams join together, they become a large river; large enough to reach the ocean. - Anish Joel, Saadho
Humanity has arrived at a System which is against Life. There is misery on Earth. No one is really happy - those with power, land or money, and those without. From today&amp;rsquo;s System needs to emerge a System and Order upheld by Realised Consciousness, Universal Values and Mutual Fulfilment; instead of money, power or fear.</description>

      <description>Happiness is our true nature. Every Human wants to be happy. All prophets, relegions and philosophers have spoken the same truth in different ways. And yet Humanity has evaded the light of happiness somehow. Most of us are caught in a blind rush, desiring happiness from actions or objects, forgetting that it is available to everyone all the time. We are doing things in order to be happy, and not as beings of happiness.</description>

      <description>We believe family education is the way to educate our selves, and bring forth a new System and Order. By family, we mean at least two people committed to being together for Life, and growing with mutual fulfillment. Family is the fundamental social unit for mutual wellbeing; and safe and comfortable space for collective discussions, study, contemplation and meditation upon Life and Living. An integrated, enlightened and healthy family is the basic unit for an integrated, enlightened and healthy human society.</description>

      <description>Three kinds of Lifemaker members While we are talking of members as individuals here, we are in reality rcruiting families! Families are our favorite target audience, because in togetherness is the living proof of the individual&amp;rsquo;s realisation and happiness. And also, most of us feel most comfortable and at home, with our families which provide us the nurturing environment to grow.
Elders (or Budhdhas) By elders we mean the Self realised souls, who shine forth with unblemished illumination of the Revelation.</description>

      <description>Singularity - All is ONE. ONE is All. Like gold exists as the self same in all jewels (forms) and even without jewels, but the jewels have no existence without the Gold, what exists as the unchanging same in all that is, and also where there is none of that, is the Source of everything. Because that Source is eternal, omnipresent and unchanging, free from desires and ever fulfilled, it&amp;rsquo;s nature is happiness.</description>

      <description>About Who are the people involved in this project? Some of our founding members have a direct experience of the blissful nature of Existence through contemplation, meditation and Samadhi experiences. Some have an objective and scientific understanding of reality as-it-is, and wish to share the same with the world. Some are those whose hearts and minds have been moved by the way humanity is failing today on all important fronts of existence and co-existence.</description>
