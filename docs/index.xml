      <description>Three kinds of Lifemaker members While we are talking of members as individuals here, we are in reality rcruiting families! Families are our favorite target audience, because in togetherness is the living proof of the individual&amp;rsquo;s realisation and happiness. And also, most of us feel most comfortable and at home, with our families which provide us the nurturing environment to grow.
Elders (or Budhdhas) By elders we mean the Self realised souls, who shine forth with unblemished illumination of the Revelation.</description>

      <description>Singularity - All is ONE. ONE is All. Like gold exists as the self same in all jewels (forms) and even without jewels, but the jewels have no existence without the Gold, what exists as the unchanging same in all that is, and also where there is none of that, is the Source of everything. Because that Source is eternal, omnipresent and unchanging, free from desires and ever fulfilled, it&amp;rsquo;s nature is happiness.</description>

      <description>About Who are the people involved in this project? There are many people who’ve helped/inspired the LifeMaker project and have given an invaluable contribution to its inception. Currently Ayush Ghai and Federico Peccini are helping coordinate the movement. We are joined by a bunch of elders, volunteers and supporters in different roles.
Can I join? Everyone is welcome to join. Our tribe welcomes people from any walk of life. Just that we wish you join with your family or community, with whom you live on an intimate basis, so that we are more effective.</description>
