      <description>We believe that There is an infinite source of happiness and abundance in our Heart. It is omnipresent and unchanging. It is One, manifesting as many, each playing a unique role in the World created by the same One. We may have forgotten our true nature but deep down we all seek the same. Love, Happiness, Oneness, Truth, Knowledge, Abundance, Contentment, Nature, Singularity, Supreme Self â€“ all are different names or faces of the same.</description>

      <description>We envision, in next few years, a positive paradigm shift in human consciousnessness and state of individual and collective affairs. We will face tought times because of our ignorance, past actions or natural disasters, but with help of each other, we will do well overall. Average human will be happier, more loved and more resourceful than today.
We will move from egoism, separationism and conflict, to love, inclusion and singularity. Reorganising ourselves under a more compassionate, sensible and decentralise collaboration, we will flourish along with nature.</description>
