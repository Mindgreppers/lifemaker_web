<h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3>

<p>In order to align together our only refuge is to understand universal reality and come together with that perspective to live together as &ldquo;humans&rdquo;. For this we need a parallel program for educational and societal reform over next 30 years. Here are the key points of the current proposed approach.</p>

<h4 id="the-team">The team</h4>

<p>(Team formation currently in progress. Volunteers invited)
A set of people who have understood well enough and are committed to the cause to constitute the working teams at different levels from international to national to village level. You can contribute in any way you want and can.</p>

<h4 id="develop-the-documentation">Develop the documentation</h4>

<ul>
<li>Develop and put online, the documentation of the charter (vision, value system, objectives, guidelines (sutras), constitution, universal proposals etc), for general public to read, understand, question or give suggestions. (Currently in discussion. Some of the drafts are available on this website. Expected first official drafts in 2020)</li>
<li>The working draft of the aims and objectives, as written in 2018, can be found <a href="../https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tt9Tcn0pMVg1Q-GfvFX9ll8xko-5SuCoumR2UJG-LAw">here.</a> The working draft of charter of values, drafted in November 2017, can be found <a href="../values">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="holistic-and-universal-education-for-teachers-parents-children-and-youth">Holistic and universal education for teachers, parents, children and youth.</h4>

<ul>
<li>The education must be aimed at ensuring realization of &ldquo;human consciuousness&rdquo; &amp; universal knowledge alongside literacy, living skills and general information. Education is what shapes society. Today&rsquo;s society reflects upon education since yesteryears which provides only literacy, living skills and general information, along with some false notions like money is everything, life is a race etc. It does not provide holistic, truly useful, essential knowledge about nature of self, existence and way to live.</li>
<li>The education will have to be ensured through family at its center. The school/university have to be at the periphery outside the family, because child learns most from its parents and immediate family.</li>
<li>If we give right education in to children and youth of any region or nation over next 25 years, then we can create a new generation of &ldquo;humans&rdquo; who will live much better, more resolved and happier than our current generation.</li>
<li>There is already a good amount of content developed by some members of the society in past 30 years. You can find an introductory series on the <a href="../videos">videos page</a>. We are in process of creating an online platform for curated universal information for human wellbeing. This can be used to educate oneselves and share with others when one can not come for retreats personally.</li>
<li>When inspiration comes to someone, guide the inquirer through a set of universal proposals - through online content or personal discussions with neighborhood/friends, retreats and workshops. Help them understand and experience truth. For this develop, evolve and use universal content of proposals and explanations approved by the education council of the society.</li>
<li>Use a society run online education platform with curated, universal content to share educational content and spread the message far and wide.</li>
<li>Work with governments to reconsider the prime purpose of education and adopt universal knowledge and understanding based education in schools and colleges.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="understand-and-start-living-this-way">Understand and start living this way</h4>

<p>Each individual and family who is participating will go through a systematic process of introduction and understanding. The goodness of their thought, behavior, speech, work, conduct and their way of living will attract others towards them to find answers and resolution that every human needs.</p>

<h4 id="get-one-successful-village-to-become-the-role-model-for-rest-of-the-society">Get one successful village to become the role model for rest of the society</h4>

<p>Have some pilot villages come up with a self inspired tradition for the same. They will test the proposals as a community, evolve the proposals and the systems of self governance, and demonstrate to the world the goodness of the way to live with resolution as &ldquo;humans&rdquo;. Currently the first pilot is being initiated by residents of village Saalig, located in Tehsil Dharamsala, Dist. Kangra, India.</p>

<h4 id="start-induction-of-inspired-families-individuals-and-villages-from-across-the-world">Start induction of inspired families, individuals and villages from across the world</h4>

<p>Use online content to pass on the message and get people to initiate contact and register on the online forum. Invite people for retreats at centers hosted by existing members/famlilies who have understood and are living this way. In such retreats the understanding happens more deeply than online content.</p>

<h4 id="spreading-the-message-and-collaborating-online">Spreading the message and collaborating online</h4>

<ul>
<li>Live with understanding and wisdom and set an example for the world to get naturally inspired from, i.e. every child must see their parents and larger family live in the right way; a neighbor must see their neighbor living the right way. Every village must inspire the next. So on and so forth.</li>
<li>Develop an online forum and platform for universal content for remote collaboration and sharing. Help each other like family on that platform. Share ideas. Work together. Build the movement together.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-working-model-for-self-govnernance">The working model for self govnernance</h4>

<ul>
<li>It is a family centric approach because a physical family is the unit of society functioning and continuity, not individuals. <a href="../family">Read more about what is meant by family.</a></li>
<li>It is a <a href="../self-governance">consensus and self discipline based approach of self governance</a> where all people affected by any decision must agree with consensus (stemmin from wisdom).</li>
<li>Pick up few inspired families in pilot villages. Establish and prove the model through them.</li>
<li>Put forward the first draft of vision, values, manifesto, policies and constitution for the undivided human society. [early 2020]. The working draft of the aims and objectives, as written in 2018, can be found <a href="../https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tt9Tcn0pMVg1Q-GfvFX9ll8xko-5SuCoumR2UJG-LAw">here.</a> The working draft of charter of values, drafted in November 2017, can be found <a href="../values">here</a>.</li>
<li>Develop and set up online infrastructure to help in relevant aspects of the social program for Self Governance. For ex. register as member individual, family, group from anywhere; study and understand from online content; discuss; network; collaborate; help, get help; local circular e-commerce; travel to member spaces and families for networking, experience &amp; learning etc.<br /></li>
<li>Incubate and establish from village councils to the world council and get the program going at global level. Collaborate between these teams to ensure success of local pilots.</li>
</ul>
