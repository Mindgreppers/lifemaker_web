<h3 id="every-life-goes-through-a-process-of-evolution-culminating-in-full-evolution">Every Life goes through a process of evolution culminating in full evolution</h3>

<p>The moment a Life comes into existence it gets free from the physical forces of Existence. And it becomes bound to the force of desire. It starts to follow its desires for self fulfillment. One desire subsides. Another arises. Old desires arise again. Like waves on a sea shore, desires keep coming. Life runs here and there trying to experience every desire. And why not? The existence is infinite and so are the experiences. The very nature of conscious Life is to experience.</p>

<h4 id="life-wants-to-feel-fulfilled-in-every-moment">Life wants to feel fulfilled in every moment</h4>

<p>Till Life doesn&rsquo;t get evolved it engages in an endless pursuit of doing this or doing that.</p>

<p>As it progresses it realises that satisfaction from fulfillment of desires is only momentary and transitory because there is always some desire or the other to follow, and that same desires resurface after previous satisfaction. As it satisfies one desire after the other but still continues to feel unfulfilled it realises that true fulfillment can not be had by chasing desires or running away from things &lsquo;undesirable&rsquo;. Getting tired of chasing meaningless desires, it seeks permanent state of fulfillment, peace, ease and bliss. It realises that true fulfillment is a state within, indendent of any desire. Then it starts looking for &lsquo;that&rsquo; which can fulfill all its desires altogether. And that thing which fulfills all desires is knowledge of Self and Existence only.</p>

<p>Secondly Life starts by feeling separate from the rest of existence. As it progresses in its journey of evolution it learns with experience that all is actually One and Only and that it is an inseparable part of it. This knowing starts to become its true feeling too. This knowing of Self and Existence is intricately connected to the state of absolute fulfillment. Infact, these two come together.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-life-learn">How does Life learn?</h2>

<h3 id="only-the-whole-can-realise-the-nature-of-the-whole">Only the whole can realise the nature of the whole.</h3>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t you ever experienced knowing something so surely that you don&rsquo;t even need to think about it. Your heart &lsquo;feels and knows&rsquo;. And your mind has no doubt about it. Instead the mind works acccording to or for the feeling without any resistance or obstruction. From the depths of your heart you know what-is and the deepest part of your mind feels fully committed to go by your heart&rsquo;s knowledge and belief. Haven&rsquo;t you ever experienced full mental resolution? For example, when you knew clearly something you wanted to do or achieve for this entire lifetime and that resolution never shook from its foundations?</p>

<p>In order for the realisation of any knowledge to be full and absolute the whole of the Self has to get it.</p>

<h3 id="the-state-of-an-unevolved-life">The state of an unevolved Life</h3>

<p>An unevolved Life, which is the entire animal kingdom and practically most of humans on Earth, uses at most half of their mind and none of the soul. They use only the superficial parts of their mind, never reaching the deepest part of the Self, to contemplate, understand and realise reality. Their approach is limited to thinking, comparison, analysis, visualisation. Contemplation and total comprehension by mind rarely happens. The heart is even less touched upon.</p>

<h3 id="how-evolution-happens">How evolution happens</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Evolution or learning or understanding or growth happens when all four layers of the mind and the soul attest together to a fact in unison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Philosophy and science serve a useful purpose by helping intellectualise and open the doorway for contemplation and comprehension. But since mind is only a part of the Self, it can not realise the nature of the whole Self by itself. By the same virtue of being part of the whole Self, mind is also necessarily required for full realisation. <strong>Only the whole can realise the nature of the whole</strong> of which the mind is a part. Hence philosophy, science, maths and physics as tools are useful and as humans - necessary too, but they are not enough alone nor are they absolute as they are tools of the mind only.</p>

<p><strong>There is something deeper than the mind - it is that part of the Self which is <em>&lsquo;experiencing&rsquo;</em> everything - the body, the world, even the mind and itself. We can call it the soul or the heart or the center of Self.</strong> Heart is the deepest part of the Self. The heart is the experiencer, the observer, the expressor. It is what experiences what is experienced in deep sleep as well as in dreaming and waking life. It is like the screen on which all perception, feeling and thought presents itself.</p>

<p>Till the heart has not realised the nature of existence and experienced the bliss of knowledge, everything is mere mental concept &amp; information and not true knowledge. Till the soul is not fully realised Life does not experience peace, contentment and bliss, and does not exhibit consistency of &lsquo;moral&rsquo; living, positivism and inspiration in continuity. It is not able to do what it feels is right. There is conflict both inside and in relationship with the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heart or soul is the deepest part of you, present everywhere, experiencing everything, in every moment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When realisation of nature of Self and existence as co-existence happens, it is felt by all the layers of the mind and right through to the heart. In that moment the whole of Self knows, that it knows. And there is bliss! The attestation by the heart is joined by full mental clarity and resolution. The knowing that is so sure and certain that there is no scope of any doubt left whatsoever. When the heart is realised as well the mind has full comprehension of the realisation, Life has achieved its full evolution. There is eternal happiness, peace, contentment and bliss because the mind is fully resolved for permanence and all unecessary desires, hopes and thoughts have come to an end for good. There is stability in thought, work and behavior. Full realisation is the end of all conflict and suffering. It is the beginning of an eternal status of pure blissful existence and co-existence.</p>

<p><strong>Realisation can start from the heart and reach the mind or it can start from the heart and reverberate in all of the mind.</strong> If you notice sometimes you feel that some truth (for example &ldquo;All that is outside is also in me.&rdquo;) and it is much later the mind understands the what, why and how of that fact. On the other hand sometimes you read a statement (for example &lsquo;When I am relaxed the best things happen to Life and whatever happens happens in the best way&rsquo;), your mind contemplates upon it, comprehends it and with that comprehension there is an &lsquo;Aha&rsquo; moment deep through your mind and right through to your heart. When all the parts of you have resonated with same understanding, there is a clear resolution in the mind to live by it and there is nothing stopping you from living out your realisation. <em>You have changed for good everytime you have realised something.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Realisation is understanding is enlightenment is knowledge is bliss is peace is contentment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Every life is on the same journey of realisation and is bound to reach it. Just that each Life has a state of realisation and velocity of progress.</strong></p>
