      <description>Hello my dear ones
Here are the updates from last two months of action at Lifemaker.
 We successfully crowdfunded a movable film studio and started our outreach and awareness campaign with families in village Saalig actively.  We kickstarted the cottage industry experiment by making home made Gajak with Desi Ghee and selling it without additional generation of plastic, in village shop, local market and as well sending to some friends across India.</description>

      <description>A lot happened in these 5 months. The Good We undertood a lot more The core team at Lifemaker understood a lot more about the right approach to start this project. We learned that people do not like to talk about things. They want action. People don&amp;rsquo;t want lectures. They want to know what they can do right away to solve a problem or challenge they face. So our whole approach change from education first perspective to taking both the working model and education in parallel.</description>
