      <description>Many - sequence - arrangement - pattern - system - system and order
 When enough streams join together, they become a large river; large enough to reach the ocean. - Anish Joel, Saadho
Humanity has arrived at a System which is against Life. There is misery on Earth. No one is really happy - those with power, land or money, and those without. From today&amp;rsquo;s System needs to emerge a System and Order upheld by Realised Consciousness, Universal Values and Mutual Fulfilment; instead of money, power or fear.</description>

      <description>Happiness is our true nature. Every Human wants to be happy. All prophets, relegions and philosophers have spoken the same truth in different ways. And yet Humanity has evaded the light of happiness somehow. Most of us are caught in a blind rush, desiring happiness from actions or objects, forgetting that it is available to everyone all the time. We are doing things in order to be happy, and not as beings of happiness.</description>
