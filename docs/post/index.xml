      <description>We envision, in next few years, a positive paradigm shift in human consciousnessness and state of individual and collective affairs. We will face tought times because of our ignorance, past actions or natural disasters, but with help of each other, we will do well overall. Average human will be happier, more loved and more resourceful than today.
We will move from egoism, separationism and conflict, to love, inclusion and singularity. Reorganising ourselves under a more compassionate, sensible and decentralise collaboration, we will flourish along with nature.</description>
