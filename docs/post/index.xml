We are in discussions as an international group of philosophers, social activists and reformers, common people and enlightened beings.</description>

      <description>Happiness is our true nature. Every Human wants to be happy. All prophets, relegions and philosophers have spoken the same truth in different ways. And yet Humanity has evaded the light of happiness somehow. Most of us are caught in a blind rush, desiring happiness from actions or objects, forgetting that it is available to everyone all the time. We are doing things in order to be happy, and not as beings of happiness.</description>
